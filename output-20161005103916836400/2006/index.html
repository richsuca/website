While the day started with a lot of action (work-wise), it has settled down and I am having a good day.<br /><br />Specifics?<br /><br />I am working from home (a.k.a tele-commuting) :-), when I work from home, I am in my pyjamas, listening to music (Christmas carols) and now and then get grab something from the kitchen to eat.

<small><p>Oct 27, 2006</p></small>
<p>I spent the whole Sunday basically in the hotel room, watching TV, reading a little about Dianetics, browsing internet. All these activity had a common objective: kill time.</p>
<p>I wonder if its normal that I just cannot do anything other than sit back and &quot;kill time&quot;?</p>
<p>Sometime back, I would spend a lot of time at the computer either writing or reading about technology or programming. I enjoyed that a lot. Then there is photography. The fact that I did not making many photos in New York City shows the lack of drive in me for framing things. Maybe just relaxing is also normal. Maybe its something everybody does often. Its just that with me, I had been super occupied with things (including on weekends) and now this slow down is making me feel like I am missing something. It feels like I am becoming very lazy (I have always <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/04/21/still-struggling-with-self-discipline/">complained</a> about this). Lately, one thing has surfaced which probably people already noticed:</p>
<blockquote>I am very indecisive.</blockquote>
<p>I keep changing my plans (due to the tendency to procrastinate). Procrastination was a problem (which I confuse with laziness) but the effect of it only came to my realisation recently.</p>
<p>Case in point:-
One day before I was scheduled to travel to New York City, I had three things to do:-
a) Buy an $11 Labtec PC headset for voice chat (the current one does not work),
b) Buy a SD memory card for my camera (my current one is only 128mb),
c) Get a hair cut (I couldn't land at the airport and hotel with my very obvious uncut &amp; unkempt hairdo)</p>
<p>My plan was to leave office early at 5.30pm (my scheduled time which I never follow), go to Canada Computers near Yonge &amp; Finch, buy the PC headset &amp; memory card, then go over to China Town on Spadina, get the $5 haircut and buy Vietnam sandwich which Caroline loves. The Vietnam sandwich was not officially in my list but Caroline loves it. It was good till it came to execution. At 6pm I was still in office having already decided that I would go home in Mike's car (Mike is my colleague). Mike does not go anywhere near Yonge &amp; Finch. Procrastination at its best. I had already switched to &quot;Plan B&quot;. Plan B was to go to Future Shop near Warden &amp; Eglinton and buy the PC headset and .. well.. get haircut somewhere. The reason I made a plan earlier to go to Chinatown for haircut is that the hair cutting shops near my residence closes at or before 7pm (I reach home earliest at 7.45pm). The Vietnam sandwich had already been tossed out of the to-do list at this point (shame on me, Caroline was expecting it).</p>
<p>Anyways, at this point I had no idea where I would have the haircut (neither did my friend Mike who gets his hair trimmed by his wife). For the PC headset, we went to the nearby Future Shop and because there was no $11 Labtec there, I ended up buying a Plantronics $40 headset (typical impulsive decision that costs me  extra money). I got a good deal on the SD memory card so that offset it a little bit.</p>
<p>At this point, I got a) &amp; b) done. What is left is c) Hair Cut..</p>
<p>Coming up soon....</p>

Its one week now in Manhattan. A week of many firsts. The hotel room I am lodged in is on<br />the 36th Floor! Its the highest in terms of altitude I have stayed in. I saw the Statue of<br />Liberty for the first time (from the shores of Manhattan). First time I am staying in a four<br />star hotel for more than a day. Crowne Plaza on Broadway near Time Square is a fine hotel.<br />Had the most expensive steak of my life (I did learn a few things about steak but don't<br />remember enough to write about). Using wireless internet for the first time.<br /><br />I bought a tripod today from J&amp;R at Broadway &amp; Ann St. near City Hall Park. Look forward to<br />making night photos of Brooklyn bridge and Time Square.<br /><br />Food ? I had good Steak, Italian(pizza, pasta, meatballs, grill chicken &amp; salad), Chinese<br />(Szechuan-style prawn with peccan/Ginger chicken with vegetables), Indian(fish curry, Rajma,<br />aaloo mattar on rice and one naan), Thai(Pad See-Ew), Vietnamese (the ever delicious noodle<br />soup) and Mexican(Carnitas Burrito). Of course I had to have the street special (Shish Kebob<br />on bun) and breakfast and coffee from Dunkin Doughnuts and Startbucks. OK, so I mentioned<br />Steak as if it was a country but then I am not sure how else to classify it.<br /><br />While I made a conscious decision of not going to the same restaurant more than once, I<br />didn't realise that I had food from so many different countries!<br /><br />I have plans to visit at least 4 places this weekdend and make photos. Lets hope the weather is suitable.<br /><br />(My interest in writing has declined and it shows. I don't spend enough time thinking and rewriting. This boring blog is another sign that I need to refocus my energies on being more lively)

A few years ago, I saw and ad on TV which says that if you stood at New York's Time Square long enough, you would see everyone in the world. Maybe my memory betrays me. Maybe it said that you will meet a person from every country or something like that. Either way, that is something I remember and it is good way to describe Times Square.<br /><br />I spent most of the day at the hotel room watching TV and dozing off in between. Not a good way to spend my first day in New York City.<br /><br />Food? had McDonald's for lunch near the office and a slice pizza with spinach &amp; mushroom toppings, followed by rice pudding (half of which remains as I type this blog)<br /><br />Back to Time Square. Huge posters, billboards, bright lights, lots of people taking photos and staring at various shops and people. The current biggest poster is that of "Press Play": current music album of Diddy. You also see ads of popular TV shows like S_x in the City.<br /><br />After dinner, I took a walk along Broadway and had a chance to see the theatres and the stage plays currently on. The one I am interested in is "Mamma Mia" mainly for the live music of ABBA. The cheapest price is ~US$63 which is a deterrent.<br /><br />I also had the pleasure of talking to a taxi driver from Bangladesh, travelled on the subway (TTC is better).<br /><br />I forgot to pack my tripod with me so have not made many night photos. Lets see, maybe I will buy one here.<br /><br />More tomorrow..

<small><p>Aug 27, 2006</p></small>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I 'arranged' the dinner tonight, the word 'arranged' is being used instead of 'cooked' or 'bought' because it was neither fully cooked by me nor was all of it bought pre-cooked.</p> <p>Anyways, here is what I did:</p> <p>Visited Sobeys nearby and bought the following:-</p> <p>a) Parisienne Potatoes [large size 258 grams] - Ready to eat</p> <p>b) Campbell's vegetable condensed soup [one can]</p> <p>c) Villaggio Italian style garlic bread.</p> <p>A friend Barabara had bought us 3 Kosher Lazor Louisiana Style chicken sausages [also from Sobeys] last week when she visited. The sausage was to be the piece de resistance.</p> <p>So I boiled the sausaged in a pan and then pan fried it in very little oil [under the watchfull direction of Caroline]</p> <p>Then cooked the soup by slowly adding water and stirring it gently [hard work!]</p> <p>Dinner is served! :-)</p> <p><a href="http://www.richardhsu.net/images/Adifferentdinnersausagesoupgarlicbreadan_14A83/sausgeNpotatoes11.jpg"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="392" src="http://www.richardhsu.net/images/Adifferentdinnersausagesoupgarlicbreadan_14A83/sausgeNpotatoes_thumb7.jpg" width="640" border="0"></a> </p> <p>[have not been making photos of late and it shows]</p>

<small><p>Jun 11, 2006</p></small>
<p>Woke up early today [Sunday] just to catch the final between Roger Federer &amp; Rafael Nadal live. While it did turn out to be a decent game, the result was not exactly what I was cheering for.</p>
<p>I wanted to see a piece of history made today [Federer has won the last 3 majors, this would have completed a sort of 'grand slam' of all four majors in a row, something which has not happened for a long long time] but he had Rafael Nadal in his path and just could'nt get it done losing in 4 sets.</p>
<p>Its been at least a few years now since I last watched a tennis match end-to-end. Most of my tennis watching was during the Pete Sampras-Andre Agassi era. But the matchup between Federer &amp; Nadal was one which got me back into watching.</p>

The world cup starts this Friday and I ordered an addition to my cable TV package today.<br /><br />Here in Toronto, the World Cup will be covered by 3 channels out of which I had 2 already. But, as a die hard Brazil team supporter, I had to order the 3rd one so that I don't miss any of the Ronaldo-Ronaldinho action. I will not be watching the Monday to Saturday matches live as I will be at work :-( but hopefully, no one at work will discuss the results with me and I can enjoy the repeat telecasts [or what is called 'encore' here] as good as live.<br /><br />Watching and following world cup alone [Caroline is not much of a sports fan] will not be the same as back home in India where every one at home and in the city will be jumping up and down and ohh and aahing and cursing together..  Soccer, if its not already, will be the prime source of gossip and debate in Kolkata and I will miss that.<br /><br />Soccer world cup is the most watched TV event in the whole wide world but I am not sure how people in Toronto follow it. Will find out and report back.<br /><br />ole.. ole.ole.ole....ole....

Unlike most people, my vehicle of choice is a cycle, I don't own one yet, but when I have $300 dollars to spare for myself next summer, I will go for this cruiser.<br /><br />How did I learn about this, in a subway advertisement by some soya food company. Actually, there is a contest to win such a cycle which I have entered. Lets see, maybe I wouldn't have to shell out money or wait till next summer.<br /><br />I bought myself a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardhsu/">digital camera</a> last christmas, i am saving up some something again this christmas, computer upgrade ? an SLR camera ? a cruiser bicycle ? don't know..

<div>Asked by a geek-friend about like in Canada, here is what I came up with :-<br /><br /></div><div>Life in Canada, just like everything in life,  has good, bad and ugly.</div><div> </div><div>Good:</div><ul><li>I can  attend <a href="http://www.learn2asp.net/Campaign.aspx">3 webcasts</a> and get Visual Studio 2005  [Standard Edition], an ASP.NET 2.0 book all for free!! [this offer is only  available in US and Canada, so can't apply from India, but you can still attend  the webcasts] </li><li>Anybody in Canada can  buy an <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/07/ipod-mini-just-one-week-savings-at-min.html">iPod mini with just one week's pay </a>or the  all new Intel Core Solo powered <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macmini/">Apple Mini </a>with 2-weeks of work, any work.  </li><li>A month of <a href="http://www.shoprogers.com/Store/Cable/InternetContent/extreme.asp">6 mbps Hi-Speed internet connection</a> can be  paid with only half a days pay, again doing any job.</li><li>You can choose to work just half a day or a  just a day and get paid only for that. You can find plenty of half a day or  Saturday only jobs if you want.</li><li>Eating  at McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken is like eating deem-bhaji-thaali. Eat it  everyday if you are the thin kind [which you are Neo :-) ] </li><li>C$ 1 == INR 38!! </li><li>People who drive buses or collect garbage earn  more than most executives. </li></ul><p>Bad</p><ul><li>I don't  write code for money, so you spend 8 hours everyday doing something you <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/10/nothing-is-really-work-unless.html">would NOT do for free</a>. </li><li>I miss the outdoors due to the <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/11/i-saw-snow.html">cold and snow</a> </li><li>I eat too much fast food, because I can.  </li><li>I am in danger of loosing my Indian  accent and decent english. </li><li>I see too  much flesh all around [often within touching distance] ;-). </li></ul><p>Ugly</p><ul><li>I miss  home and everyone at home. </li><li>Last but  not the least, I miss Kolkatanet and all the geek friends like you. </li></ul><p>But life changes fast and so will my list of  Good/Bad but I am afraid Ugly will remain Ugly for some years at least.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr /><h2><a href="/2006/02/20/the-one-thing-that-really-sucks-in-canada/">The One Thing That Really Sucks in Canada</a></h2>
<small><p>Feb 20, 2006</p></small>
Ever since arriving here I've tried tea from different places. One word - sucks.<br /><br />Today, I tried it again, from Tim Horton's. I didn't get much sleep or rest for last 2 days and had a coffee in the morning to keep my eyes open. It worked for only a few hours, again my eyes were getting all sleepy and wet, I needed another coffee. But realising that 2 coffees would be too much for a day, I went with tea instead, 'steeped' tea to be more precise [as if its any different]. Steeped tea is suppose to be brewed tea just like we have in India vs. the tea bag style.<br /> <br />One sip of the tea and again, it sucks. Its just like the tea one gets on the train in India, but the train chaloo chai costs only Rs 4/- or Rs. 5/- per cup while this one costs me INR 40/-!! and its from the No. 1 coffee seller in Canada.<br /> <br />The tea we make at home is definitely much better, still not like the milky bihari-style chai we get in Anmol or from that place in Behala near our shoe shop.<br /> <br />Lesson of the day, don't pay for tea in Canada, have coffee instead.
