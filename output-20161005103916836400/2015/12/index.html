<small><p>Dec 11, 2015</p></small>
<p>My daughter reached an important milestone today. She was allowed entry into Ikea's children's play place called Sm√•land. Ikea shoppers can leave their kids in the supervised play place for 40 minutes at a time. The play place has toys, movies, sponge balls etc. that keep the kids entertained while their parents/guardians shop in peace. My older son has played at the play place every time we have shopped at Ikea over the years.</p>
<p>Since the facility is designed for a certain age group, there is a minimum and maximum height requirement for entry. Few months ago, my daughter was shorter than the minimum height requirement and wasn't allowed to play in there. She was disappointed but I told her if she ate lots of food, she would grow the few inches she needed to get in. Today, we were shopping at Ikea again so I took her to the play place. The entry supervisor asked her to take her shoes off and stand against the measurement wall. To our pleasant surprise, the top of her head was just touching the line marking the minimum height and they let her in!</p>
<p>This marks a small but significant milestone in her life and ours. We don't weigh or measure our children's height so it is these simple and small life events that makes us pause and think about their growth.</p>
<p>Another funny story related to my daughter happened last night. I was dressed and ready to go out when I realised the cell phone wasn't in my pocket. Thinking it was upstairs in my office room, I asked my daughter to go get it for me. She could not find it(it was in my jacket pocket) but came back with the cordless phone handset. She said she couldn't find my cell phone so I should have the cordless phone instead.</p>

<hr /><h2><a href="/2015/12/06/shutter-priority/">Lesson in Photography: Using Shutter Priority</a></h2>
<small><p>Dec 06, 2015</p></small>
<p>I was handed the camera(Canon DSLR with Yongnuo flash) at my friend's birthday dinner last month. I pointed the flash to the ceiling(bounce), set the dial to Aperture Priority and went about making photos. I noticed the shutter speed being calculated¬†was slower than ideal and some photos were blurry. The settings I would have used¬†in my Nikon DSLR wasn't working for this¬†Canon camera and I had trouble adjusting. To get a faster shutter speed, I increased the ISO (maybe to 800) and it seemed better. I kept making photos but was uncomfortable with the results. Towards the end of the birthday party, I changed the mode to Shutter Priority, set Shutter Speed to 1/100 sec, ISO 800 and it solved the exposure problem. I should have done that much earlier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend sent me the first 80 photos and most of them were not properly exposed due to slow shutter speed. I could see ghosting, blur, etc. in the photos. It was disappointing and heart breaking. I was trusted to document an important once-in-a-lifetime event in my friend's life and I failed. I am yet to receive the photos made towards the end when I switched to Shutter Priority. Let's hope there is enough in there to make it memorable for him.</p>
<p>I must have viewed countless hours of video, books etc. that covers exposure and the role Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO plays. Yet, when it mattered, I forgot the basics and took too long to get the right exposure and wasted important moments.</p>
<p>Next time, I will remember to set the ISO higher and start with Shutter Priority in that kind of a situation.</p>
