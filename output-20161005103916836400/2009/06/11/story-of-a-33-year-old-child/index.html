When the helpful elderly salesman was writing the invoice, he asked "Is this for your son?" (Aiden was still busy running around the store with so many guitars and pianos), I said "No, for me!", "Aha" he replied. I followed with "I have waited for 30 years to learn piano, my son is lucky he will not wait that long". The salesman smiled. I handed him my credit card, he handed me the big box that had the digital piano inside along with a smaller one for the stand and adapter in a plastic bag and that concluded the transaction. Now, I can practice piano at home! :-)
