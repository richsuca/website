<small><p>Nov 29, 2005</p></small>
Sometimes, at around 2-3 in the afternoon, the sun comes around to tease me. I sit near the window and there is a window at an angle of 10 o'clock. This window has blinds but the mechanism for dropping the blinds is defective and therefore try as I may, it doesn't drop. So I give up and just let the sun's light shine into my eyes for about 30 mins. Sometimes, some clouds dark and white come to my rescue and blocks it for a while, but the sun oh, the mighty relentless sun doesn't give up. What I am forced to do is sit a little left [inconveniently I might add] so that the wall between the windows blocks the sunrays.<br /><br />But its something thats welcome because its really really cold now about -2 or lesser.
