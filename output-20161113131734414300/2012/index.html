<p>Here are some comments on Sherwood 6' X 8' Garden Shed from Home Depot (Price: $699 + Base will cost another $200 or so)</p>
<p>More details at
<a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/product/sherwood-6-x-8-garden-shed/934835">http://www.homedepot.ca/product/sherwood-6-x-8-garden-shed/934835</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the included deck wood. They are soft and curved and not well treated. Instead buy Pressure Treated 2x4 or 2x6 from Home Depot or other stores.</li>
<li>Don't use the included nails for the decking. It does not hold well. Use decking screws instead.</li>
<li>In general, consider using screws throughout instead of nails especially where you are unsure if things will fit properly or not (all walls). Nails are not easy to take out if you have to readjust and it could damage the sheathing. We used screws for the corners. When we were sure of the fit and square, we used nails for the rest. </li>
<li>Use a lot of braces to ensure walls are square.</li>
<li>Follow instructions carefully and in order.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the offsets. The offsets are essential. We put the front and back walls flush ignoring the offset and spent a lot of time redoing it mainly due to the nails. Hence, the above advise on using screws.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time to build: 1 day
Manpower: 1 professional, 1 professional who doesn't do it for a living and two unskilled helpers. I am one of the two unskilled helpers.</p>
<p>Sherwood Shed is well designed and the materials and instructions are good. The price is also reasonable. I would recommend it.</p>

<p>My son is a Ninjago fan. Getting him to colour Kai or Cole is easy except the images he likes don't always come in a form suitable for colouring. The online tutorials on how to convert images to line art did not work for me so I got professional help from my brother Robert. He did not disappoint. Within a few hours, I got an email from him. He came up with a way to convert images to line art (for dummies). It works really well!</p>

This proposal will lead to rejection of about 280,000 applicants on the grounds that they applied before a certain cut off date. It is very clear something needs to be done about the backlog and processing times needs to be reduced but this proposal's way of doing it is unfair and insensitive to the applicant's aspirations and hopes for life in Canada.</p><p>"It‚Äôs unreasonable to keep applicants waiting for another five years" - Minister Kenney<br />But is it reasonable to reject them unilaterally and without any hint of regret or apology?</p><p>"It‚Äôs also a far cry from the nimble and responsive immigration system Canada needs to remain a destination of choice." - Minister Kenney<br />Why wait till we got so much backlog? couldn't we have predicted this much earlier? So a responsive system means if you applied earlier and have waited longer, you are rejected but if you applied later (than Feb 27 2008) then you are eligible.</p><p>Minister Kenney has the right intentions and the problem is not easy to solve but the simple mathematical solution of subtraction is not the way to go about it. This is not only about numbers. Canada is well respected world wide and I am proud to be a Canadian but I must say this one decision will have immediate negative impact on about 280,000 persons world wide and their dependants, friends and relatives both outside and within Canada. It is not difficult to see that an applicant for PR is someone who respects and favours Canada more than any other non-Canadian so they deserve more from us.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Jan 10, 2012</p></small>
<p>My friend fell victim to a computer virus(The Bad). After my standard approaches to remove the virus (including MSRT, online solutions) failed, I resorted to factory reset for the Asus laptop. Factory reset was simple and convenient (compared to installing Windows followed by drivers etc.) and completed successfully(The Good) but then I had to spend another hour removing useless preloaded applications(The Ugly).</p>
<p>Shame on Asus for making their customers suffer these 'bloatware'/'crapware' .</p>
<p>If I did not have the below guide, it would have taken me more time (Thanks David)

<small><p class="post-date">Jan 08, 2012</p></small>
Yesterday, I was at the India Visa office to collect my passport. As one would expect, the majority of people in the office at the time were Indians and also as expected, everyone was wearing typical winter clothes: down jackets, sport jackets, coats etc. In short, the clothing was typical western winter wear. But there was one lady that was stood out. She was wearing a sari, Indian jewellery like bangles, rings and even had a nose stud that is common in India. There were about 30 people in the office including staff but she was the only one who was not wearing typical western winter attire. But that is not the interesting part. The interesting part is she was a white lady! So, in an India visa office filled with brown people wearing typical western winter wear, there was this one white lady wearing traditional Indian clothes and jewellery. What an inversion!
