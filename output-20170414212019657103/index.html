<small><p class="post-date">Apr 10, 2017</p></small>
<p>I wish a phone call is <em>still</em> about something other than a donation, credit card, survey, vacation, or duct cleaning. Most of the time it isn't so I hardly pick up phones now. If I am nearby, I will glance at the caller ID and see if I recognise the name or number. Most of the time I don't so it goes unanswered and the automated voice messaging system takes over. If I am <em>still</em> nearby, I will listen to the voice message. Most of the time, there is none. If the message is from someone that isn't soliciting, I will call back.</p>
<p>It is sad that marketing calls have turned a simple, elegant solution into a nuisance.</p>
<p>When I was a kid (90s in Kolkata, India), my elderly neighbour had the first phone in the entire building! Her son in Germany sponsored what was then a luxurious gadget. The ring of the phone was distinct and eventful for everyone in the building (we had open doors and windows during the day). Others in the building or nearby also benefited as they got prearranged calls from distant places. It was a magical gadget. Eventually, we got one as well. Having a phone at home eliminated errands I despised. I didn't have to bike to the residential gas cylinder office and stand in line for an hour to book a replacement. A phone call worked.</p>
<p>The Canadian <a href="https://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/insnum-regnum-eng">National Do Not Call List</a> and regulatory <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/duct-cleaning-companies-pay-55-000-for-violating-do-not-call-list-1.3007159">enforcement</a> has helped but it hasn’t eliminated marketing calls completely. I am looking forward to a screening solution like Adblockers, firewalls, etc. for computers. Hopefully, it will bring the magic back, when the voice of a person follows my <em>Hello</em> and we have a delightful conversation.</p>

<p>Adele noticed the <em>No Smoking</em> signs at the train stop and said:<br />
Daddy! Look! No smoking!</p>
<p>A lady standing by heard it and smiled. </p>
<p>Later, inside the train, Adele noticed <em>No Smoking</em> signs again and said:<br />
Daddy! Look! No smoking!</p>
<p>The same lady, now sitting across from us smiled and said:<br />
She is a sweetie. Like mommy, taking care of Daddy.</p>

<p>Standing in the snake line<br />
Waiting to pay<br />
Passing my time at Winners<br />
It's half day<br />
Notebooks on the left<br />
Protein food on the right<br />
Thinking to myself<br />
I am feeling bright</p>

<p>Adele was sleepy after dinner so I carried her to the powder room to brush teeth. I asked her "is your battery down?" She replied "no, it's blinking".</p>
<p>Me: Aiden, you will get a kick.<br />
Aiden: Is that a methaphor or a simile?<br />
Me: It is a prediction.</p>

<p>Wanted Root Beer.</p>
<p>I would have settled for a Diet Coke or anything cold and fizzy.</p>
<p>Skipped McDonalds because of three cars waiting at the Drive-Through.</p>
<p>Skipped the convenience store because I felt lazy to park the car.</p>
<p>At the mall, I went to the juice seller, ordered a Mango juice instead.</p>
<p>The lady taking the order heard Mango Smoothie and that is what she shouted to her colleague behind the counter.</p>
<p>I heard it but did nothing.</p>
<p>I got the Mango Smoothie, forced myself through half of it, and then threw the rest into the garbage.</p>
<p>Wasted perfectly edible Mango, water, and all that went into the Smoothie.</p>
<p>Wasted $5.</p>
<p>I still crave a Root Beer.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Nov 13, 2016</p></small>
<p>I slept at 3am due to a dinner social event that ended late and also my pre-sleep bad habit of labouring over specification, benchmark, review, and pricing of desktop computer parts and camera equipment. <a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2012/03/04/10-tips-on-how-to-cure-yourself-of-gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome/">G.A.S</a> attack comes and goes but it is especially brutal between the November to January Birthday-Christmas season. I am close to the bottom of that now but that is a story for another day.</p>
<p>So this morning, sleepy and lethargic, I was vacuuming the basement and not enjoying it at all when I found a small toy in a corner. Recognising it as a Shopkin, I gave it to my daughter who was happy to get it back. She said "Oh! that's my <a href="http://shopkin.toys/shopkins/54/1-054:jelly-b:rare">Jelly Bean Joe</a><sup>*</sup>".</p>
<p>And just like that, life is interesting again!</p>
<p><small>
* Online, I found references to Jelly B. but not <em>Jelly Bean Joe</em> so I asked my son. He educated me that it is a character from the TV show Odd Squad.

<small><p class="post-date">Oct 25, 2016</p></small>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's not kid ourselves, Canada is in the war business<br />
Why the Canadian government hasn't criticized Saudi Arabia for its brutal attacks in Yemen [?]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil Macdonald, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-canada-macdonald-1.3810952">CBC</a>.</p>
<p>Canada has a conflict of interest because Saudi Arabia is the No. 1 customer for our <a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/new-details-revealed-about-saudi-lav-sale-by-general-dynamics-land-systems-canada">military business</a>. The 14-year $14.8 billion <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/04/canada-would-face-multi-billion-dollar-penalty-if-it-cancelled-armoured-vehicle-sale-to-saudis.html">contract</a> to sell Light Armoured Vehicle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV_III">LAV</a>) is just 0.20% of Canadian <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/160406/t003a-eng.htm">exports</a> annually but Canada's business reputation and 3000 jobs are at stake. There is no win-win here. Faced with a choice between a big business deal and 3000 Canadian jobs versus the safety of innocent civilians in far-away countries, Harper chose Canada and Trudeau did the same. Canadians, not the innocent civilians of Yemen elected them Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Other arms exporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World.27s_largest_arms_exporters">countries</a> are not clean either.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used simple and clear language in his <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-09-20/secretary-generals-address-general-assembly-scroll-down-bilingual">address</a> to the General Assembly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Powerful patrons that keep feeding the war machine also have blood on their hands.  Present in this Hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Oct 10, 2016</p></small>
<p>I got my daily <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/narcissism.html">A.Word.A.Day</a> (AWAD) email and the word of the day was <em>narcissism</em>. This was the first of many words related to the <em>con man running for the president of the United States</em>. Many things have been said and written about him but a few quotes in the email still surprised me and pushed the bar of narcissistic behaviour lower. I shared the AWAD email with my friend Deepti and her response was interesting. She was more curious about <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anu/">Anu Garg</a> (creator of AWAD) and told me his bio is impressive. That made me go to wordsmith.org to read more about him. One of his creations is the <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html">Internet Anagram Server</a>.</p>
<p>Curious to try it, I typed "Yet another blog" and clicked on <em>Get anagrams</em>. The anagram <em>Altogether Bony</em> got my attention and I liked it. I considered giving my website a name before but didn't like the names I could think of. Google search for <em>Altogether Bony</em> showed results related to <em>bones</em> but the exact phrase was not in use. It was a nonsensical name, had A. B. initials, and made me think of bare essentials. Deepti didn't like it because it made her think of bones too so she went back to the Internet Anagram Server and looked at other anagrams of <em>Yet another blog</em>. She recommended <em>A Lengthy Reboot</em>. Voila! It was geeky, relevant, and interesting.</p>
<p>So that is how this website got its name.</p>
<hr /><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/09/29/chaipress/">Chaipress</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">Sep 29, 2016</p></small>
<p>On a September 1st afternoon, I found an article about <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/698452/">Linux kernel GPL enforcement</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. It referenced Torvald's <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-August/003580.html">reply</a> on the thread. I read it and enjoyed the argument made and the style it was made in. It also got me curious about plain text formatting (<code>*bold*</code>, <code>_underscore_</code>,  <code>[footnotes]</code>, <code>&gt; for quoting</code>). I suddenly had a desire to write like that and wondered if there was a blogging service that supported that. My website <em>was</em> on WordPress and it could work using <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> Html tag but plain text wasn't <em>the</em> only way to write.</p>
<p>So I Googled for "plain text blog" and found <a href="http://calepin.co/">http://calepin.co/</a> and it was nice but not exactly what I was looking for. I noticed the words "Powered by Pelican" in the footer. That got me looking up <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and I learnt it was a "static site generator written in Python". Interesting<sup>1</sup>. On the same Google results page, there was a blog post about <a href="https://www.notionsandnotes.org/tech/web-development/pelican-static-blog-setup.html">building a static blog with Pelican</a>. The post describes blogging options and makes an argument for static site generators. It also provides step-by-step instructions to get Pelican working, but the most useful paragraph for me was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hosting resources required for public deployment are very small, 
allowing one to use very cheap hosts such as NearlyFreeSpeech. Outside the domain registration costs, 
the running costs come to less than $1 per month, which is a great saving!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> was the final<sup>3</sup> ingredient needed to make <a href="https://github.com/richsuca/chaipress">Chaipress</a> - my own static site generator. I don't know if it was the geekiness of NearlyFreeSpeech's website, their philosophy, or the pricing but it got me started and I had the first generated website up on September 17th. Writing the generator didn't take long but importing my WordPress posts did<sup>2</sup>. And I forgot about the plain text <em>only</em> thing that started all this.</p>
<p>I called it Chaipress because Chai(tea) is simple, easy-to-make, low cost, and refreshing. The <em>press</em> is a suffix borrowed from the names of other blogging systems (WordPress, Octopress).</p>
<p><small>
Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python is my favourite and Blogging apps are an eternal curiosity of mine. I did try Pelican. </li>
<li>Text encoding mistakes. WordPress posts were not in Html so I had to convert them using Markdown. In hindsight, I could have left it as-is and converted them during page generation instead.</li>
<li>My previous attempts at writing my own blog engine went nowhere. When I started working as a programmer, blogging was <em>a thing</em> and writing a blog engine was also <em>a thing</em>. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10491873">It</a> <a href="http://www.staticgen.com/">still</a> <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=blog">is</a>.</li>
