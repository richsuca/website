<p>I wish a phone call is <em>still</em> about something other than a donation, credit card, survey, vacation, or duct cleaning. Most of the time it isn't so I hardly pick up phones now. If I am nearby, I will glance at the caller ID and see if I recognise the name or number. Most of the time I don't so it goes unanswered and the automated voice messaging system takes over. If I am <em>still</em> nearby, I will listen to the voice message. Most of the time, there is none. If the message is from someone that isn't soliciting, I will call back.</p>
<p>It is sad that marketing calls have turned a simple, elegant solution into a nuisance.</p>
<p>When I was a kid (90s in Kolkata, India), my elderly neighbour had the first phone in the entire building! Her son in Germany sponsored what was then a luxurious gadget. The ring of the phone was distinct and eventful for everyone in the building (we had open doors and windows during the day). Others in the building or nearby also benefited as they got prearranged calls from distant places. It was a magical gadget. Eventually, we got one as well. Having a phone at home eliminated errands I despised. I didn't have to bike to the residential gas cylinder office and stand in line for an hour to book a replacement. A phone call worked.</p>
<p>The Canadian <a href="https://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/insnum-regnum-eng">National Do Not Call List</a> and regulatory <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/duct-cleaning-companies-pay-55-000-for-violating-do-not-call-list-1.3007159">enforcement</a> has helped but it hasn‚Äôt eliminated marketing calls completely. I am looking forward to a screening solution like Adblockers, firewalls, etc. for computers. Hopefully, it will bring the magic back, when the voice of a person follows my <em>Hello</em> and we have a delightful conversation.</p>

<p>Adele noticed the <em>No Smoking</em> signs at the train stop and said:<br />
Daddy! Look! No smoking!</p>
<p>A lady standing by heard it and smiled. </p>
<p>Later, inside the train, Adele noticed <em>No Smoking</em> signs again and said:<br />
Daddy! Look! No smoking!</p>
<p>The same lady, now sitting across from us smiled and said:<br />
She is a sweetie. Like mommy, taking care of Daddy.</p>

<p>Standing in the snake line<br />
Waiting to pay<br />
Passing my time at Winners<br />
It's half day<br />
Notebooks on the left<br />
Protein food on the right<br />
Thinking to myself<br />
I am feeling bright</p>

<p>Adele was sleepy after dinner so I carried her to the powder room to brush teeth. I asked her "is your battery down?" She replied "no, it's blinking".</p>
<p>Me: Aiden, you will get a kick.<br />
Aiden: Is that a methaphor or a simile?<br />
Me: It is a prediction.</p>
