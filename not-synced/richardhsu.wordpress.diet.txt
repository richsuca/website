Seeing my son go to the babysitter is painfull. He is weeks shy of 2 years, but knows that he has to go, and does not complain, but you can see it in his face(expression of resignation) and his good bye is very soft and has a tone of sadness. The babysitter loves him and takes very good care of him and I am sure when he does reach his home, he is his normal active-happy self.

This weblog will be a way to reach my friends and family at home. To help bring about some connection between my life and that of my family and friends. Time flies by and with this weblog, I hope to be able to make things more interesting, memorable and hopefully more honest.<br /><br />'Just a minute' ? well, i have been procrastinating with just about everything in life, job search, calling people up, writing mails etc. and thought that this blog will make me take at least one minute a day [or in a few days] to sit down and <span style="font-weight:bold;">think</span>.<br /><br />Feel free to share this blog with others who might be interested to hear from me. I will appreciate if you take time and write a comment. Thanks.<br /><br />remember, the website is <span style="font-weight:bold;">"richardhsu.net/weblog"</span>

I was setting up Gemini Bug Tracking on Sql Server 2005 and had hit a few problems [problem == challenge] while Caroline was busy selecting and searching the songs to put into the compilation. But, the aunt in question is scheduled to leave day after and that meant I couldn't procrastinate any more. So some effort was initiated at building up a few CDs with instrumentals [from my collection], some Cliff Richard's popular hits and few popular songs.<br /><br />When I put one of the compiled CD in the audio system [Technics, multi speaker, surround], it played and we were treated to songs which brought a smile to Aunt's face. She was on the phone with her son and she put the phone near the speaker to let her son hear it!! It was gratifying to see her happy with this little effort of ours and thats what this blog is about [in case, you were wondering].<br /><br />Now I am happy that I did the Cds. Its simple little things like this that makes life worth living. It has made me positive and a little more lively [being jobless has supressed most of my humor for quiet sometime now].<br /><br />Music is great.

The advantage of living in a developed country like Canada can be illustrated by how long one takes to save up for an iPod mini. A guy i know recently bought an iPod mini from Apple.com for about Canadian$ 260. How long does it take to save C$ 260 ?

The official minimum salary is about C$ 8 per hour. So you are guaranteed to get C$ 8 per hour or more. Most people get more. Still, say you get C$ 8/hour for 40 hours a week [which again is standard], you end up with C$ 320!!, of course you have to subtract taxes etc.

Even at the maximum [30%], at minimum salary, one can save C$ 224 a week. With this, one can buy a reconditioned iPod mini for C$ ~190 OR work one more day and buy a brand new iPod mini from Apple.com.

I don't think there is much to say about, by Indian minimum salary standards, how long would it take to save up for iPod mini [Rs. ~11,000 according to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.in/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=104136&amp;item=5789403630&amp;rd=1">eBay India</a>].

No. I am not buying one [I am unemployed right now, so I can only save C$ 0.00]

She basically meant that she didn't trust 'him' at all. The expression was different and 'yucky'.<br /><br />Case 2:<br />A guy to another guy - "I couldn't sleep last night because it was too hot"!!!!!???<br /><br />Did I hear him correct ? "too hot", while we were all dressed up in jackets. Yesterday's weather was between 13 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius [normally the min. temperature-7 degrees is at night, when everybody tries to sleep]. I suspect, most people, like me, in the Greater Toronto Area was under thick blankets last night while this gentleman was sweating sleepless!! Man, is everything in the world relative, cold for one is hot for another [maybe he is the only 'another' amongst the millions of Toronto residents :-)]

"Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else." -- <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26911.html">James M. Barrie</a><br /><br />This quote cannot be more apt when applied to my present situation.<br /><br />Till about 3 months back [June 2005], I never really did any work. I was employed full-time and paid by technology companies from 2000-2005 for solving problems with computers but it was never 'work'. Honestly, I didn't even realise how time flew by and I had been programming computers professionally for the last 5 years. I don't remember ever feeling like "oh shit, tomorrow's monday". I don't remember feeling relieved and happy to leave office and go home. In fact, for the last 5 years, I may have spent more than 80% of my 'awake time' doing something or the other with computers. If not programming, then reading about technology. Ocassionally, assembling computers or troubleshooting computers at friends and relatives. Everyone who knows me, know that the only thing I know about is computers and thats about the only thing I really like and can talk for hours on end about.<br /><br />Coming back to 'work'. I do work now and have been working for the past 2 months. About a month in the restaurant as waiter and now in a bank's back office doing data entry. It sounds like I am not happy with it but thats not the case. Money is the main consideration now behind my daily efforts. With programming, money was secondary and a bonus. See, the word 'daily' and 'efforts' got associated with work.<br /><br />Programming and technology is a part time hobby now. Also, I have developed an interest in photography which continues to jostle with technology for my 'free' time.<br /><br />Of course, a lazy person like me would prefer not to have to work at all. I have tried to get into technology companies but have not succeeded yet. Maybe next year, some organisation will pay me for having fun with computers again. Until then, I will work.

First evening at the apartment. I am tempted to say 'new' apartment as its a totally new experience for us but the apartment is housed in a fairly old building, in fact, it was occupied by some people before us and we can safely assume many more before them. My uncle Lawrence was kind enough to help us carry all the furniture and belongings and also arrange for his friend to bring his truck for moving the stuff. Dennis [Tseng] had moved quite a lot of things already last night into the garrage. Dennis is a genuinely nice guy and one of few people who can sit and have a long chat with Caroline &amp; myself. The stuff we moved in with includes a double bed, a cupboard, a side cupboard, a Sony TV, a really good computer table, a table with 2 chairs, a sofa, 2 phones [one cordless with answering machine], toaster and many many more things which I am able to mention, all given to us by Yun Hua Khew &amp; Khew mei &amp; family. When we finished loading everything into the truck and was saying good bye to Yun Hua Khew &amp; Khew Mei, all of us had tears in our eyes. That says it all. Caroline does get emotional but I hardly do and yet I couldn't help myself when Ah Khew was about to give me a good bye hug. We have been provided with the best of house to stay in when we landed here in Canada, the best of food, cooked by Khew Mei, all the support which all meant that we never had to face any discomfort and felt right at home. May God bless their family and provide us an opportunity in future to be useful to them as well.

Today, around 2pm at work, someone mentioned "its snowing" and my head turned to the window. It was not snowing as heavily as in winter, rather it was very light snow, called flurries [Caroline introduced me to this word]. Caroline aptly provided an analogy that this was like a snow drizzle. But I could see it, and it was beautiful, the opposite building's black colour provided an excellent background and contrast to it. I stopped whatever I was doing and went to the window. I told my colleagues nearby that I am seeing snow for the first time and they all smiled and were very happy for me. I remember seeing the white snow bouncing off the outer edge of the window and it was a nice sight. Someday soon, it will snow again and I will hope to make a photo of it. Better, I pray that God let everyone witness it personally.<br /><br />Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..

Sometimes, at around 2-3 in the afternoon, the sun comes around to tease me. I sit near the window and there is a window at an angle of 10 o'clock. This window has blinds but the mechanism for dropping the blinds is defective and therefore try as I may, it doesn't drop. So I give up and just let the sun's light shine into my eyes for about 30 mins. Sometimes, some clouds dark and white come to my rescue and blocks it for a while, but the sun oh, the mighty relentless sun doesn't give up. What I am forced to do is sit a little left [inconveniently I might add] so that the wall between the windows blocks the sunrays.<br /><br />But its something thats welcome because its really really cold now about -2 or lesser.

Ever since arriving here I've tried tea from different places. One word - sucks.<br /><br />Today, I tried it again, from Tim Horton's. I didn't get much sleep or rest for last 2 days and had a coffee in the morning to keep my eyes open. It worked for only a few hours, again my eyes were getting all sleepy and wet, I needed another coffee. But realising that 2 coffees would be too much for a day, I went with tea instead, 'steeped' tea to be more precise [as if its any different]. Steeped tea is suppose to be brewed tea just like we have in India vs. the tea bag style.<br /> <br />One sip of the tea and again, it sucks. Its just like the tea one gets on the train in India, but the train chaloo chai costs only Rs 4/- or Rs. 5/- per cup while this one costs me INR 40/-!! and its from the No. 1 coffee seller in Canada.<br /> <br />The tea we make at home is definitely much better, still not like the milky bihari-style chai we get in Anmol or from that place in Behala near our shoe shop.<br /> <br />Lesson of the day, don't pay for tea in Canada, have coffee instead.

The world cup starts this Friday and I ordered an addition to my cable TV package today.<br /><br />Here in Toronto, the World Cup will be covered by 3 channels out of which I had 2 already. But, as a die hard Brazil team supporter, I had to order the 3rd one so that I don't miss any of the Ronaldo-Ronaldinho action. I will not be watching the Monday to Saturday matches live as I will be at work :-( but hopefully, no one at work will discuss the results with me and I can enjoy the repeat telecasts [or what is called 'encore' here] as good as live.<br /><br />Watching and following world cup alone [Caroline is not much of a sports fan] will not be the same as back home in India where every one at home and in the city will be jumping up and down and ohh and aahing and cursing together..  Soccer, if its not already, will be the prime source of gossip and debate in Kolkata and I will miss that.<br /><br />Soccer world cup is the most watched TV event in the whole wide world but I am not sure how people in Toronto follow it. Will find out and report back.<br /><br />ole.. ole.ole.ole....ole....

Woke up early today [Sunday] just to catch the final between Roger Federer &amp; Rafael Nadal live. While it did turn out to be a decent game, the result was not exactly what I was cheering for.

I wanted to see a piece of history made today [Federer has won the last 3 majors, this would have completed a sort of 'grand slam' of all four majors in a row, something which has not happened for a long long time] but he had Rafael Nadal in his path and just could'nt get it done losing in 4 sets.

Its been at least a few years now since I last watched a tennis match end-to-end. Most of my tennis watching was during the Pete Sampras-Andre Agassi era. But the matchup between Federer &amp; Nadal was one which got me back into watching.

A few years ago, I saw and ad on TV which says that if you stood at New York's Time Square long enough, you would see everyone in the world. Maybe my memory betrays me. Maybe it said that you will meet a person from every country or something like that. Either way, that is something I remember and it is good way to describe Times Square.<br /><br />I spent most of the day at the hotel room watching TV and dozing off in between. Not a good way to spend my first day in New York City.<br /><br />Food? had McDonald's for lunch near the office and a slice pizza with spinach &amp; mushroom toppings, followed by rice pudding (half of which remains as I type this blog)<br /><br />Back to Time Square. Huge posters, billboards, bright lights, lots of people taking photos and staring at various shops and people. The current biggest poster is that of "Press Play": current music album of Diddy. You also see ads of popular TV shows like S_x in the City.<br /><br />After dinner, I took a walk along Broadway and had a chance to see the theatres and the stage plays currently on. The one I am interested in is "Mamma Mia" mainly for the live music of ABBA. The cheapest price is ~US$63 which is a deterrent.<br /><br />I also had the pleasure of talking to a taxi driver from Bangladesh, travelled on the subway (TTC is better).<br /><br />I forgot to pack my tripod with me so have not made many night photos. Lets see, maybe I will buy one here.<br /><br />More tomorrow..

Its one week now in Manhattan. A week of many firsts. The hotel room I am lodged in is on<br />the 36th Floor! Its the highest in terms of altitude I have stayed in. I saw the Statue of<br />Liberty for the first time (from the shores of Manhattan). First time I am staying in a four<br />star hotel for more than a day. Crowne Plaza on Broadway near Time Square is a fine hotel.<br />Had the most expensive steak of my life (I did learn a few things about steak but don't<br />remember enough to write about). Using wireless internet for the first time.<br /><br />I bought a tripod today from J&amp;R at Broadway &amp; Ann St. near City Hall Park. Look forward to<br />making night photos of Brooklyn bridge and Time Square.<br /><br />Food ? I had good Steak, Italian(pizza, pasta, meatballs, grill chicken &amp; salad), Chinese<br />(Szechuan-style prawn with peccan/Ginger chicken with vegetables), Indian(fish curry, Rajma,<br />aaloo mattar on rice and one naan), Thai(Pad See-Ew), Vietnamese (the ever delicious noodle<br />soup) and Mexican(Carnitas Burrito). Of course I had to have the street special (Shish Kebob<br />on bun) and breakfast and coffee from Dunkin Doughnuts and Startbucks. OK, so I mentioned<br />Steak as if it was a country but then I am not sure how else to classify it.<br /><br />While I made a conscious decision of not going to the same restaurant more than once, I<br />didn't realise that I had food from so many different countries!<br /><br />I have plans to visit at least 4 places this weekdend and make photos. Lets hope the weather is suitable.<br /><br />(My interest in writing has declined and it shows. I don't spend enough time thinking and rewriting. This boring blog is another sign that I need to refocus my energies on being more lively)

I spent the whole Sunday basically in the hotel room, watching TV, reading a little about Dianetics, browsing internet. All these activity had a common objective: kill time.

I wonder if its normal that I just cannot do anything other than sit back and "kill time"?

Sometime back, I would spend a lot of time at the computer either writing or reading about technology or programming. I enjoyed that a lot. Then there is photography. The fact that I did not making many photos in New York City shows the lack of drive in me for framing things. Maybe just relaxing is also normal. Maybe its something everybody does often. Its just that with me, I had been super occupied with things (including on weekends) and now this slow down is making me feel like I am missing something. It feels like I am becoming very lazy (I have always <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/04/21/still-struggling-with-self-discipline/">complained</a> about this). Lately, one thing has surfaced which probably people already noticed:
<blockquote>I am very indecisive.</blockquote>
I keep changing my plans (due to the tendency to procrastinate). Procrastination was a problem (which I confuse with laziness) but the effect of it only came to my realisation recently.

Case in point:-
One day before I was scheduled to travel to New York City, I had three things to do:-
a) Buy an $11 Labtec PC headset for voice chat (the current one does not work),
b) Buy a SD memory card for my camera (my current one is only 128mb),
c) Get a hair cut (I couldn't land at the airport and hotel with my very obvious uncut &amp; unkempt hairdo)

My plan was to leave office early at 5.30pm (my scheduled time which I never follow), go to Canada Computers near Yonge &amp; Finch, buy the PC headset &amp; memory card, then go over to China Town on Spadina, get the $5 haircut and buy Vietnam sandwich which Caroline loves. The Vietnam sandwich was not officially in my list but Caroline loves it. It was good till it came to execution. At 6pm I was still in office having already decided that I would go home in Mike's car (Mike is my colleague). Mike does not go anywhere near Yonge &amp; Finch. Procrastination at its best. I had already switched to "Plan B". Plan B was to go to Future Shop near Warden &amp; Eglinton and buy the PC headset and .. well.. get haircut somewhere. The reason I made a plan earlier to go to Chinatown for haircut is that the hair cutting shops near my residence closes at or before 7pm (I reach home earliest at 7.45pm). The Vietnam sandwich had already been tossed out of the to-do list at this point (shame on me, Caroline was expecting it).

Anyways, at this point I had no idea where I would have the haircut (neither did my friend Mike who gets his hair trimmed by his wife). For the PC headset, we went to the nearby Future Shop and because there was no $11 Labtec there, I ended up buying a Plantronics $40 headset (typical impulsive decision that costs me  extra money). I got a good deal on the SD memory card so that offset it a little bit.

At this point, I got a) &amp; b) done. What is left is c) Hair Cut..

Coming up soon....

I started blogging at <a href="http://richard.rediffblogs.com">Rediff Blogs</a> and it still has my blogs. I am moving now to blogger as I find it better than rediffblogs. But it was rediffblogs that got me into blogging.
<br />
<br />I have tech blogs at <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richardhsu">GeekDojo</a> and a <a href="http://richardhsu.blogspot.com">collection of tech (programming mostly) resources on the internet</a>.
<br />
<br />But here, I will post all non-tech stuff like what I did, what I think about certain things etc. Mainly for myself to read in future but also as a means of communicating with my friends.

Very soon I will again be changing jobs. Frustrating, very frustrating, either its me, or its my luck. Somehow, I manage to find reason(s) or reason/opportunity comes and I have decide to move. Where will I be next year this time ? only time will tell, only thing I can guaratee about is I'll still be hacking code... :-) hopefully in C#/.NET.
<br />
<br />One thing I want to get right is my ability to save money, after all these years, I still find myself time and again in near empty pocket situations. This has to go in my resolution.

I don't know why, but I hate to leave jobs, yet I have changed jobs too frequently for my own good. What did I do here whole day ?
<br />
<br />browsing the net, what else, catching up on my blog/article reading. Plus, I managed to setup free web hosting for a techie group called Kolkatanet that I am part of, also setup a private discussion group in Yahoo groups, (I am not linking them here cause I don't want this blog to come up too in public). Life changes again tomorow onwards, as I will be unemployed and (hopefully) relaxing for next few days till the 9th, I am very excited about the digital camera I'll be buying before I travel to Shillong for Edmund's (friend &amp; brother-in-law) engagement. We'll see some photos then.. Hope and pray that BDTech is where I will settle down for a while..

I bought a digital camera (<a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=1055&amp;pq-locale=en_US">Kodak Cx6200</a>)few days back and since then I have been clicking photos, have clicked about 40 of them already !! no only a few of them are mine, I have even clicked a few silly ones like the one I took of the digital taxi meter.
<br />
<br />Good thing is we can transfer all the photos to the PC and empty the memory out. Bad thing is it needs battery.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am learning some photography skills (this is my first own camera) and find it difficult to get an entire view into the preview rectangle of the camera, I guess thats the challenge (want more, have less is actually the challenge of life). Will post some photos here or link to the page that has it.

ok, I didn't fly. but I travelled from Guwahati to Kolkata in an air plane. Caroline and I boarded a Sahara air plane today on our journey back from Shillong (there is lot I want to say about the Shillong trip, but via another post). This is the second time I am travelling in air but I was a small kid the first time around and can't remember anything, so effectively this is the first air travel experience for me !!
<br />
<br />I wish I had something to write on while I was looking out of the window. I was looking at this amazing scene and all sorts of words and descriptions were going through my head. Lets see if I can describe what, according to me, it looked like, It was as if we were above a desert of clouds, or snow, like the atlantic - full white, in the distance I could see the powerful orange light of the sun and around it was like a river of gold flowing down, or rather oasis of gold. Prior to all this, I could see the landscape of Assam's fields and river Saraighat (I guess it was that), like those we see in Discovery channel.
<br />
<br />I marvel at technology, technology that enables me to reach from one place to another in about an hour whereas using the train it takes about 20 hours. Huge difference. Yes, I had those often described as 'near-vomit' feelings as the plane was taking off but its not really a problem. What engineering must have gone inside the plane to make it fly flawlessly. Makes me want to work harder and learn more.

I left Kochi(Cochin), Kerala a few years back, deciding to settle back in Kolkata. To say the least, its been a very difficult ride for me since then career-wise, although things seems to have started on the upside when I joined MindTeck, again I was given an opportunity to come back here in Kochi and start another chapter in my short but very fragile career book. So here I am, again back in Kerala, back with some old friends, back to (hopefully) better financial times. The weather is good, better than Kolkata, and the place seems exactly like before. Only thing thats really changed is me and my job details. Last time I was here, I travelled in Sleeper Class train, this time, AC Train :-) . Last time I was surviving on a meagre 4500/- per month and eating plain dosa for dinner, now, well its much better.
<br />
<br />When I actually reached here and was in the hotel room at night, I couldn't believe that I was actually away from home and in another place. Sometimes I find it difficult reconsiling with the current situation - that I am away from home, different place, different language, different food, different almost everything. Only when one is away does one realise what home really is. Its actually painful at times (I guess everyone who leaves home feels the same) but its better than last time around when I actually cried :(
<br />
<br />I pray to God that he protects my family and wife Caroline. I think this is the first time I'll write in public that I really really miss her. If only she was with me, things would have been very different, I never realised this, but she is everything I need. Hopefully things will turn out better than last time and I'll get her here soon instead of me leaving and going back.

Funny thing, after a month long rest at home, I am slowly getting back to writing code and thinking about logic again. only when I work do I actually realise how much I enjoy programing. I can go from one thing to another and never really get tired or bored.
<br />
<br />Caroline wanted to blog about her what she does and her thoughts and I spent hours fixing my xml based blog application till 3 am today.
<br />
<br />I have this little problem, sometimes I get so much hooked into the enjoyment part of my work that I forget that I have to finish stuff too, so we can deliver, so we can get paid, so I can get paid. This is one thing I have had a lot of problem with since the beginning.

Last weekend, I managed to go to Bangalore and spend it there with Paul (my cousin brother) and Lily (cousin sister) and her family (Jason, his friend Steven and parents). It was nice although the whole big thing about Bangalore being this and that is in my opinion overstated. The best thing (as I have realised) about any place is the people. By that measure, obviously Kolkata is the best place :-)
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am not going to Bangalore again this weekend so I will spend the weekend alone here in Kochi. Its about 10 mins since the last of the office fellows have left and now I am alone. When I was back home, I always wanted space, personal time, and indeed at times I would just shield myself from everything and just be lost. But now, I crave family and home.
<br />
<br /><strong>Life is strange,
<br />when its hot, want cold,
<br />when its cold, want hot,
<br />always wanting what is not.
<br /></strong>
<br />
<br />Don't have plans for the weekend other than, wash underwear and try to get Caroline's school program running again. I have got Jackie Chan's movie Shanghai Nights dumped in one of the pcs, so that should give me about 1.5 hours of entertainment and hopefully inspiration to work hard with determination.
<br />
<br />Will try to do some work for a change in weekends too.

<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7b8dc7cd-033a-4cb8-ba3a-6eabbd6d96d4">Dare Obasanjo aka Carnage4Life - The Sex &amp; Cash Theory</a>
<br />
<br />THE SEX &amp; CASH THEORY: "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." - Hugh Macleod
<br />
<br />Dare Obasanjo's take on that :-
<br />"That blog post sums up a lot of my thinking recently. Designing the classes in System.Xml is a decent day job but I only really light up in front of a computer when I'm fixing bugs or adding features in RSS Bandit. One pays the bills, the other allows me to express myself without artificial limitation in my medium of choice."
<br />
<br />My take :-
<br />Dare works for Microsoft, from where I am thats suppose to be super cool and 'dont-have-to-work-for-day', 'only-fun' type of a job, but even he doesn't consider his day job as 'sexy', so what more can I say, for a long time I have been looking for a sexy job and this took me through many employers in as many years, Only now and with the curent job that have i realised and accepted this duality, that its not about fun, its about cash, and I should stop looking at my job and work as sexy, because its not, we are doing business. This has definitely made things better for me and put a lot of internal conflicts and unease to rest.

How true.
<br />
<br />My wife left for Kolkata about an hour back, we had a great time this past two weeks. We went to Trivandrum, Kanyakumari, around Kochi/Cochin and visited a colleague's house in Vypeen island near Kochi, a lot of traveling and fun. From a personal perspective, we also spent a lot of time together. It was just a few months back that I left Kolkata, then we started planning her visit here and the next thing I know is she is here.
<br />
<br />Now she is sitting in AS1 of Allepey-Chennai train, sad and pondering about the future while I am here, back in my office-cum-residence, alone and keying away. Its painful and for a few moments I thought about the decision I have taken, to work away from home, away from family, friends, and last but not least, away from Caroline. The good thing is, we are agreed upon her settling closer to me, probably in Bangalore, or here in Kochi. Lets see how it pans out.
<br />
<br />My heart is heavy and a little sad, but I am happy that we had a lot of fun. I look forward to tomorrow, a brand new day, full of hope and freshness. I'll not talk anymore about the sad part, rather I am happy for all the good times we had, looking forward to the fun in store for me at work and her settling down closer to me soon.
<br />
<br />Life is beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes happy..

I was creating nero disc images of the three VCDs of my wedding today, when I opened the second CD to view it. It brought back memories, happy ones, of my wedding day. That part was showing us about to start serving tea to everyone young and old.. forwarded it a little bit and it reached a point where we were asked to kiss and were posing for the photographer, then there was this huge demand for me to carry her. :-)
<br />
<br />My heart gives a million thanks to Michael Huang, a friend who volunteered to video our wedding with his personal video camera for free. We had [stupidly] thought of cutting cost and not opting for a professional video guy. If Michael had not done it, I wouldn't have any today. On hind sight, we should have had Peter Shu [an excellent pro and friend's dad] video our wedding also. I think I asked him only two days before, he was already booked for that day :-( [stupid me]. Anyways, Michael was God sent [God has always covered for my stupidity] and he did a decent job of it.
<br />
<br />So many friends, relatives, neighbours etc. were present and it was so nice of everyone to have come and attended. I realised how ugly and stupid I look [thank God, Caroline liked/ignored my face]. It was an all happy occassion for everyone. I can't believe I went through all that with Caroline and me at the centre of it all. I am a shy person and now when I think about it, I managed ok.
<br />
<br />Its nearing 2 years now..  we're getting along, working things out.

There are two non-tech blogs that I read often. One of them is by my friend Anita and another by Deepak Gulati, a Microsoft guy that I interacted with over email. Both of their blogs have one thing that draws me to them. You read things totally original. You read something which is very personal. Well, this blog of mine is also original &amp; personal, but it is written in very simple [dry] english and there is nothing poetic. They have a natural gift for poetry, art and they are more sensitive than me. Anita's blog has more poetry while Deepak's has a lot of photos coupled with his detailed descriptions of his observations [he sort of operates at a very very low level in english language, he uses a lot of big words, the kind I get every day from 'A Word A Day'].

I am subscribed to <a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/">WordSmith's A Word A Day</a> and today's word was <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/horatio_alger.html">Horatio Alger</a>. That's not the reason for this post, the interesting part is that the mail had a <a href="http://gutenberg.org/author/Horatio+Alger">link</a> to an eBook which had Horatio Alger's stories. I don't know exactly what made me go to the next page and download the <a href="http://gutenberg.org/etext/5623">"The Young Explorer"</a>. So far, I've read only the first chapter and its so much fun. Its a book a child can read. Simple and very interesting, reminds me of my young self. :-)
<br />
<br />Here is something I find the most interesting in chapter 1: Ben, a boy of 16 says to his Uncle "I want to go to California."
<br />
<br />I am curious and excited about what young Ben will do in California, how he'll survive alone, the people he'll meet and the trials &amp; tribulations that he'll go through to find his fortune.
<br />
<br />I am child at heart and there's a smile on my face, just like a child who has got a new toy to play with.

Just a few hours more and I'll be on my way back home, back to Kolkata. Last time I left, I had no idea I would come back to this beautiful city, yet when I arrived I had no idea I would be leaving it so soon, indeed it has be short but with lots of memories. My heart is a little heavy right now. Don't know where the train of life will take me.
<br />
<br />I maybe returning soon, or maybe not for a long long time. Either way, it will not be the same.
<br />
<br />Bijus just reached India today and before leaving for his home town, he gave me a farewell hug, both of us have a lot of things to say, we had a lot of plans for our company, it seems I'll not be playing my part fully this time. I could sense a little sadness in him as he could in me, he has been a great friend,  still, my only mentor, still, the only manager I am totally happy with. I wish I could have done more. I disappoint him and our company in many ways, yet I have no option.
<br />
<br />The security fellow Ramesh will drop to the station and help me get my luggage on the train. He has been a great help to me. Although we hardly understand each other's language, we have been able to communicate.
<br />
<br />I must also mention my colleagues Bert Thomas and Deepu Sreedhar, they have also helped me feel at home.

My gradmother is old. She is ~80 years of age and have been completely bed ridden for the last few years. For me, my grandma has played the typical grand mother's role. She would buy things for me, feed me, beat me, make me do chores, helped me get my first computer and paid for my Microsoft certification course. In short, a lot of what I am today is because of her. It would be dishonest to say that she is all nice but i don't want to remember her for the 'not-nice' things.<br /><br />There was a time that I totally distanced myself from her and became cold to her. She could speak properly then, she could sit up and was much better than the state she is in now. But I ignored her and also hated her at times [my reasons are irrelevant now]. Now, I regret and want that time to come back so I could spend more time with her. It pains me to see her in her current state, she is begging me to bite her vein so she could die. She refuses to take medicine or food and my mum has to force it down her throat so she could be 'alive'. She had a  minor stroke and as a result her left eye doesn't open now. Its always shut. Her right eye opens but due to the tears and contant lying down, its watery all the time. Everytime I look at her and hear her moan, it tells me one thing, she doesn't want to be 'alive' anymore, she wants to be relieved of the physical and mental pain. Its just a matter of time before she'll finally decide not to fight anymore and give up. She repeatedly expresses her desire to die as if someone in thirst is asking for water. There are many other very disturbing things that she does in desparation, things which any [normally] hyper active person would do in the state that she is in.<br /><br />All her life, she has always been in control of things, to a certain extent been in control of things in every family members life. She is a self dependent, hard working type and for a person like that to be completely bed ridden, weak from a recent surgery is hell.<br /><br />It has been a truly humbling experience [i was away from home for the last few months]. Looking at her, the meaning of life and living takes on an altogether different meaning. We shouldn't take health or life for granted. Certainly we should not take the people around us for granted, be it spouse, parents, brothers, sisters or relatives and friends [no particular order intened]. So now i always think of each moment as being special and precious and automatically things look better, happier. I am happy and thank God for giving me a chance to be nice to my Grandma but at the same time I can't help but pray to God to relieve her of her pain and suffering.

6 digits weigh heavily on me. never imagined that i would have six digits on the left column. although irrelevant now, i still find myself wondering if its all worth it ? things like this touch on the core and base of our thinking, our reasons, of course the reason still stands, so i continue on this unknown path, its almost a gamble, yet i find myself optimistic. God only knows what mental torment i go through at times, knowing that i have worked very hard for what i have today, the opportunities, recognition, reputation, all of which i am trading for an unknown, extremely expensive venture.
<br />
<br />there is a word in Hindi - "Aukaat", i am trying things way beyond my "Aukaat", this is something i have never done before, all my life, its always been about staying true to my standing. Yet, now i have 6 digits. My staying still since my birthday this year has only added to the weight. Its like burning a candle from one side and not adding wax at the other side, worse now and then, i do burn it from the other side as well!!

No buses running till after Christmas, have asked an agent to try for a train ticket, if I am lucky, I'll hopping on the train at around 2am [a few hours from now].
<br />
<br />In short, have been travelling way too much lately, not sure where I will be. Everything has been very uncertain since June this year. I hate to pack and unpack and watch people say 'bye'. Don't like it at all. Yet, I have opted for it.

Following is an extract from <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2004/10/26/the-joy-of-reading-stories/">"The Young Explorer" by Horatio Alger</a> :-

In this part, a group of american gold miners are bullying and questioning a Mongolian [generalised by the author as a Chinaman]. The funny part is about the way a Mongolian [and indeed a Chinese] speaks english.

Irish-American : "...Where do you come from?"

Mongolian [named Ki Sing] : "Me come from 'Flisco." [Its suppose to be 'f<span style="font-weight:bold;">r</span>isco', short for San Francisco]

It is well known that a Chinaman cannot pronounce the letter r,

which in his mouth softens to l, in some cases producing a ludicrous

effect.

"What have you come here for, Cy King, or whatever your name is."

"My name Ki Sing."

"Well, it's a haythen name; anyhow," remarked Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.

"Before I'd have such a name, I'd go widout one intirely. Did you

hear the gintleman ask you what you came here for?"

"You bling me," answered Ki Sing shrewdly.

There was another laugh.

"That Chinee ain't no fool!" said Dick Roberts.

"What made you leave China?" he asked.

"Me come to Amelica fol gold."

"Hi, ho! That's it, is it? What are you going to do with your gold

when you find it?"

"Cally it back to China."

"And when you've callied it back, what'll you do then?"

"Me mally wife, have good time and plenty money to buy lice."

Since yesterday evening, I've been working on a laptop as my primary computer. I've used laptops before but never had one which was dedicated to me. The fun thing is that its also my first real Windows XP experience. Its now configured for email, both official and personal [runs both Outlook and Thunderbird] and my elaborate development tools is also setup and running.
<br />
<br />At first I found it annoying [described later] but soon got used to it. The upside with this [and indeed most] laptop is the display: its flat and is not CRT based [<strong>C</strong>athode <strong>R</strong>ay <strong>T</strong>ube, the kind we have in most TVs today]. Rather its based on what I believe to be some sort of LCD technology [<strong>L</strong>iquid <strong>C</strong>rystal <strong>D</strong>isplay, the kind we have in calculators]. Also, the brightness and contrast is very smooth on the eyes. With <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx">ClearType</a> feature enabled, the text is really easy to read and looks nice.
<br />
<br />The downside is the performance and compactness [the keys on the keyboard are laid out differently, making it difficult to type fast [I have to keep looking at the keyboard now, but I am getting better :-)]. I am used to having a few nifty utilities like <a href="http://wordweb.info/free/">WordWeb</a> etc. open all the time, but I can't afford that now. Oh, and before I forget, the surface of the laptop is hot [no pun intended]. Especially on the left bottom edge of the keyboard. That area is in direct contact with the 'under-side' of my left wrist and its not pleasant at all.
<br />
<br />Thus far I have only this much to report [there is more, but I would then be completely twisting this personal blog entry around a technical axle. Its bent enough already :-)]

<br />
<br />i have gone through security check also, sitting in Sify's iWay waiting for the Emirates plane to come at approx. 4:30am. Although browing here is a little expensive at Rs. 60/hr, its ok, by paying Rs. 60/- i will be able to spend 1 hour rather than just sit and wait. i didn't carry any book also thinking that i will be in the plane and will get magazines to read.
<br />
<br />the whole flying experience is not particularly interesting, but i am going to a visit two new places and that is a little exciting.

I am listening to Girish Karnad read President Abdul Kalam's autobiography "Wings of Fire" which amongst other things also talks about the failures that the Indian space and missile programmes faced. He remembers fondly the naive criticisms he received while the Agni missile launch was delayed time and again due to technical reasons. Hearing him, I now realise how easily we criticize and try to frame people for their faults without thinking twice about what we are doing. What good purpose will our snide comments serve ? Are we helping, if not, then we should be supportive and keep quiet.<br /><br />From today, I will keep this in mind and hopefully hurt people lesser.

I just viewed the short documentary "The Legend of Fat Mama-Stories from Calcutta's Melting 'Wok' ". Its shows the Indian Chinese at Kolkata and covers our food habbits, new year celebrations and also the India-China war of 1962. Its amazing that a small and insignificant community like ours would interest people enough to be aired on BBC World. But I must point something out, in the documentary, it talks a lot of about 1962 war with China and the ill treatment to the Indian Chinese at that time.

To set the records straight, India is amongst one of the world's best places for anybody to live in. Inspite of the communal problems, its a place where anybody could settle and prosper without any hindrances. Of course, as its a developing country, the ills of corruption and uncivilized conduct of some people will be felt occasionally but then this applies to all Indians and not just to Indian Chinese. I have never really felt any issues arising out of the war on our generation and I am positive it didn't affect anyone of the generation before me either. As a proof, one only needs to look at the general economic condition of the Indian Chinese. I am proud to be Indian and also proud of my Chinese origins. There is no conflict or problems at all.

Since June 2004, I have been to Kochi[Cochin], Chennai, Bangalore, Dubai [U.A.E] and Ghana and my travels have only reconfirmed my above statements. India is a good place to be in. If people in our community are migrating, its purely because western countries offer better life style [social security, health care, less corruption etc. etc.] and not because we have been ill treated or something. We are migrating for the same reasons as Malayalis going to the Dubai or Sadarjis to Canada.

Every time I decide that I will not do any work at home, I end up working out of home. Unlike previous times, the arrangements at home for working is much better. But I am still the same, basically. So, inspite of everything working in my favour, I keep getting my priorities wrong and therefore I am still struggling to get any work done from home. Its cost me a lot financially. Still I don't seem to learn. I'll be taking a new place which is far from my present home, where [hopefully] I will be able to spend more time on work. I am taking on huge cost by moving to another place and time will tell if its justified.<br /><br />I truly envy people who manage to work for a company for years and years. They gather a lot of experience and good will. In contrast, I have an attention span of a kid. Within a year, I get bored and demotivated, start looking for something else to do technologically. I've been lucky till now, but need to correct myself quickly. Else, I'll end up being talked about 'the kid <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">had</span> a lot of potential'.

<br />Tomorrow, I start on a journey to return it to my employer. For good.

Friends of mine already know what I think about Kerala and its people, especially Kochi [Cochin]. Its the most beautiful place that I have ever visited. No wonder, someone came up with "God's own country" as a way to describe this green carpeted state. But its not only the land scape or the natural beauty that is nice about Kerala, its also the people here.

Keralites are mostly honest, civilised and nice people. This I state in comparison to people in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Maharashtra and a few other states that I know a little bit about. This is an entirely personal opinion [as it always is].

Just last night, on the train from Chennai to Ernakulam [Cochin], the air conditioning in the coach I was in was not working and there was a married couple with a sweet little daughter and the poor child couldn't tolerate the heat in the air tight AC coach. My other co-passengers were also very uneasy but then, most of the people travelling were from Kerala [most were Malayalis] and so they showed patience and acknowledged the efforts the railway folks were making to fix the AC. I didn't hear any shouting or abuse, the kind that we can expect from a people from other parts of the country, especially my home state Bengal. I look 100% Chinese [read: foreigner] and in all my stay in Cochin, in hotels, while traveling in auto rickshaws, buying things from shops, I have never come across a person who tried to cheat me or fool me given that I am not a local. Trust me, I would know if they tried it. Contrast this to Chennai, Kolkata. Mumbai and other cities where railway stations are filled with touts and crooks.

I have been eyeing a few things for a while now, first a Digital SLR and now a Music System. I did buy the camera(<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm" title="Nikon D40">Nikon D40</a>) but returned it unused. The price dropped to $429 at Blacks and I just could not resist it. The thought of that amount in my credit card bill was enough to make me pack it again and head back to the store to return it. Its still in my mind(especially now that Nikon has an "affordable" <a href="http://nikon.ca/en/Product.aspx?m=14310&amp;disp=Overview" title="Fast DX Lens">35/1.8</a> for DSLRs)

The other thing that I have recently started wishing is a surround audio system to go with the 46" LCD. There was a good deal at Futureshop last Saturday(Polk Audio RM6880 5.1 speakers + Yamaha 6130 receiver for $499.99) which ran out of stock by the time I called to check. Just as well, as I realised later that the small surround speakers will work well for movies but it might not satisfy me for music hearing(listening to FM radio is a regular source of my entertainment). So I will probably buy a pair of bookshelf speakers to start with and add more later to complete the surround sound system. Lets hope I get a sizable refund when I do my taxes next week.

The above two are the ones that I have thought the most about, but they are not the only gadgets in my list. There is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/imac/" title="Apple iMac">Apple iMac</a> which I hope to buy in 2-3 years from now when my current desktop will become ancient and I will finally switch out of Windows. I have been thinking about a NAS device recently as my current storage reaches 90% usage levels.

Ah. Too much desires but not enough $$$ to satisfy them yet. I will wait.

If you like your job, stick with it. the next job that you think you will like more, probably will suck and you'll end up regretting and working hard every sec, every hour, every day without really being productive.

My job currently involves sending out mortgage docs. Sometimes there are a lot of docs to send out, sometimes there are very few and you have free time. But most of the days I get just about enough work to keep me busy for the whole day. When I get a lot of docs to send, I typically start applying optimisations to the way I work. Ok, I am not about to discuss the patented techniques I use but suffice it to say that batching things, doing top priority things first, putting my eggs in many baskets and looking ahead do help me finish things on time.

Lets talk about each of them in more detail:-
a) <strong> Batching things</strong>: Instead of going through my normal step 1, step 2, step 3 with each doc, I avoid step 1 and step 3 and only do step 2 for every doc. I postpone step 1 till a few days later while I do step 3 for all the docs together at the end of day. This helps speed up the process a lot because I reduce the time needed by switching contexts.

Ok, you are falling asleep already. Don't fall a sleep yet. Let me try to explain my optimisations in a different way.

Since I can't talk about what I do at work, I will use an analogy to explain it. Say we are in a Chinese restaurant and my job is to do doing take-outs or what in India we would call parcels/packing.

So the process goes like this:
1) a customer is hungry and comes in to order food.
2) the cashier takes the order and money.
3) since the order is taken with a carbon paper, there are two copies of it.
4) one copy goes into the kitchen for the chef to cook and prepare the meal.
5) the second order comes to me.  my job is to pack the food, include the napkins [also known as tissue/serviets/cleenex here], paper plates and plastic disposable spoon &amp; forks [if requested], put in the complementary packets of chilli &amp; soya sauce and ONLY a single packet of the [top secret] chilli vinegar.

At this point, while the chef is also batching things up inside [ie. trying to cook all similar items together] we will take a look at what different methods I can apply in order to handle multiple orders in an efficient way.

So, if we only had a single order at a time, life would be easier and simpler. All I would do is wait for the kitchen to give the individual boxes/containers and I would keep checking with my order list. Once everything in the order list was in, I would stack them up and put them in a plastic carry bag. Then put in the sauce, plastic cutlery etc and tie a neat knot and hand it over to the customer.

But life is never that simple or single threaded [geeky term] so instead of single order at a time, we get many orders at a time and instead of the kitchen processing one order at a time, they give things randomly [the degree of randomness depends on the no. of cooks that is inside the kitchen]. The kitchen will not bring everything out at the same time, they will put things out as they are done.

Ah, you see, now we need a strategy and rethink our process a little bit. We can't apply the same 1,2,3 now. So first, we make sure that we have all the order slips in ascending chronological order. Earlier orders are on top and later ones below it.<strong> Thats prioritising for you. Doing the most important things first</strong>.It is less likely that the person who just placed an order will start question when it will come out [although you will meet with fools like these as well]. But if someone ordered a food 20 mins back, he will get bored standing there [and seeing other people get their food] and ask about his order.

Now that we have the list in order, we could just pick the top of the list and wait for the items to come out from the kitchen. Say the order list reads as follows :-

1 Chilli Chicken [with gravy]
1 Mix Fried Rice [Pork included]

Now, given this order, we are expecting a tin container with chilli chicken and a box of friend rice. One may come out before the other, its not a problem. But what we find is one of the following:-

a) chilli chicken [you wish]
b) 2 chilli chicken
c) 5 chilli chicken
d) chilli chicken [dry, no gravy and the small note saying that this one is without garlic or onions as per order!!]
e) to z) many other possibilities exists which only very imaginative people can figure out or better from real life experience.

Now what do we do ? take the ones we need for this order and keep the others for later guessing that the other orders after this will need it. This will work, except that the next order may just be for only 1 chilli chicken and yet, that person would have to wait for the first order's friend rice to come out before he gets his chilli chicken. Imagine, that the rice is not cooked yet, so the fried rice will take some time and all this while, even though we may have complete items for other orders, we hold it back because we are working only one order at a time. <strong>So don't put all your eggs in one basket</strong>. Don't serialize things that you shouldn't serialize . Think multithreads [geeky again..]. What we do is work on multiple orders at the same time, we lay out as many order lists on the table as space will permit. The earliest order will be on the right and later ones to the left of it [the right side being closer to the kitchen].

Ok, so now when we get if we get something from the kitchen, we start matching them to the orders starting with the right most [earliest] order and moving to the left till we find it being listed in one of the orders. When we find a match, we place it near the list in such a way that we tell that the item is for this list.

This way, first things get done first but it doesn't block the less important things from being done. Given that the kitchen will cook things according to their convenience, we will finish packing more orders this way than the simple way.

Still reading ? good. because we are almost to the end of the story. Just a little more and we are done for today.

The last important technique that helps me is look-ahead. Coming back to packing food, if we just layout the order lists and wait, we would suddenly start scrambling when the first or first few items start coming out of the kitchen.

Why ? because if the orders have many items and there are many orders and the kitchen throws out like 10 things at time all of which is not necessarily for the same order, it would be quite difficult to match things to the orders. You can go items-wise or the order-wise. You can pick one item and look at the order list top to bottom, then next order list top to bottom. Or you can pick the first item in the first order list and look at the items that just came out of the kitchen.

Say there are two orders:-
1st Order
- 1 chilli chicken
- 1 mix fried rice

2nd Order
- 1 Kung Pao chicken

and the kitchen gives you Kung Pao chicken and mix friend rice together. Then you can either pick one chilli chicken and start looking at the 1st order top down or you can look at the first item in the 1st order and see if is there in the cooked items or not.

I know this one is easy because you have only 2 items in 2 lists and the cooked items are 2 but when you have like 30 items in 15 different orders and the kitchen sends out 7 things at a time, the simple matching approaches discussed above, although correct, will be very slow. So, what to do ?

<strong>Anticipate</strong>. Read the first few orders into you head and remember it. While you are finishing an order and reaching out for the sauce packets and spoons etc., start looking at the next order. Because you are an expert and you can do all this without looking, you should have your eyes reading the next order that is not already in your mind forgetting the order you just completed. This way, you don't just stand and staring at the order to memorise it. These small time savings can total to a huge difference in delivery time and its a proven thing. Believe me.

To summarise, I have recently learnt to prioritise, do more than one thing at a time and anticipate which has resulted in me finishing my work faster. Today is one of the rare days when I have not much work to do and so I share this secret with you :-) In retrospect, if I had applied such secrets to my past 4 years in software development, I would, perhaps, be in a totally different place today.

This is my 4th visit to stylish city of Montreal, Quebec in less than a year. My liking for the city keeps increasing with every visit. The buildings, the people, the language, there is something in it that makes me want to spend more time here.

What did I eat? Philly Cheese Steak medium sized pizza. The guy who took my order turned out to be from Bangldesh and, as has happened a lot, he is surprised to know that I am from India and can speak bengali!

We had a good conversation in bengali mostly about me and what I was doing in Montreal. I asked him if he knew a good bangladeshi restaurant closeby and he introduced me to Maharaja at the intersection of "Rue Guy" and "Rene Levesque Boulevard". Will try that out for dinner tomorrow as I have not had Bangadeshi/Bengali food for a while now.

The medium pizza was tasty but more than I could eat. I went though the first two slices nicely but ate only the steak parts of the rest of the slices, regrettably wasting a lot. Even though I did not consume it all, my stomach now feels heavy and over expanded after a glass of water.

The hotel I am staying at(3rd time now) is "St. Paul". Compared to the other hotels I have had the privilege of staying at, this one is the best in terms of its stlying. Its also the cheapest. When you enter your room, you will hear classiical music playing on the radio and the overall lighting and design and layout of things is perfect.

While I cannot wait to be back at home in Toronto, this week should go well in Montreal.

One constant exercise I have to go through is changing the balance between what I will allow my son to do and what I will not. I want him to learn things by figuring it out himself but also protect him (and others).

Lessons learned:
1) Don't let him play with Styrofoam: He will enjoy it but I will not (enjoy cleaning up after). I was assembling a coffee table and asked Aiden to help me remove the packaging and put them back in the box, which he did very happily. While I was busy fitting the legs, within minutes he had broken up the Styrofoam in pieces and it was all over the floor. Grrrhh!. Its not easy cleaning it up using a vacuum either because it breaks up into very little pieces which are light and sticks to things(including your fingers).

2) Don't let him play around things that are unstable, like a bicycle. While we were waiting for our ferry at Pelee Island dock, I decided to rent a bicycle with a kid's trailer at the back but did ride too long as I went too fast and scared Aiden :( . So I put the bicycle on its stand and was talking to my wife Caroline while Aiden we busy inspecting the cycle. He did something that caused the trailer to detach which hurt his thumb very bad. His thumb nail almost came off! Its much better now but that was a scary experience for me and a painful one for my son.

When the helpful elderly salesman was writing the invoice, he asked "Is this for your son?" (Aiden was still busy running around the store with so many guitars and pianos), I said "No, for me!", "Aha" he replied. I followed with "I have waited for 30 years to learn piano, my son is lucky he will not wait that long". The salesman smiled. I handed him my credit card, he handed me the big box that had the digital piano inside along with a smaller one for the stand and adapter in a plastic bag and that concluded the transaction. Now, I can practice piano at home! :-)

As if my life depended on it, I went full speed and before they reached my place (they were only a few minutes late), the foyer, living room, kitchen, my son's toy room, my computer room were all nice and clean and tidy! I don't remember seeing all the rooms this tidy in recent weeks and its quite enjoyable now thanks to visitors.

Last Sunday, I was a guest in a restaurant named "India taste". The restaurant is owned by a north Indian serving a mixture of north Indian and "moghlai" food (e.g. tandoori chicken). I don't think the owners targeted Chinese-Indians or Indian-Chinese but I was surprised to see all the customers there were Indian-Chinese (more than 50 of them!). Given that our community is small here (Toronto), everyone was surprised as well and there was a lot of greeting and "hi"/"hello" going on. Amazing.

This is yet another example that Indian-Chinese are quite special in that we incorporate all the goodness of China and India and Canada.

I finally outsourced my website hosting after running it at home for over 2 years. This is intended to be an interim measure before I move it Google App Engine (maybe 2011). Wordpress is an impressive blogging program with a good balance of ease of use and flexibility.

This is part of my list of things that I will let go of in 2010. Not having to run a website from home means no need to have a computer always on and connected. Now I can repurpose the computer for something else (try a *nix desktop again!).

Another thing I let go of recently is the dual monitor setup(having used it for over 1.5 years). Now I have only one monitor. The objective is to remove clutter, simplify which should help me focus better.

I finally got my first Digital SLR camera. As expected, it's a Nikon D40 body with the 35/1.8 DX lens. It does exactly what I wanted: Make good photos indoors with available light. But it has also started me on another more philosophical thing.

When I started making photos, my goal was to capture a moment in a frame, as is. No manipulation, no artistic touch (as if I have any). All these years, my goal has been to reproduce reality with photography. So the photographs I upload are exactly as it came from the camera (with cropping applied if needed). The bokeh, color and light I get with the DSLR makes the photograph look good but quite different from reality. This has got me thinking about the artistic aspects of a photography.
<blockquote>I'm not trying to reproduce nature. I encourage people to be creative. I personally use any sort of artificial anything I can to create the look I want. I'm expressing my imagination, not trying to duplicate reality. -- <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/filters.htm">Ken Rockwell</a></blockquote>
So, this year, I will start to apply more than just cropping to "finish" my photographs.

Another thing I will do more is take photo of people rather than only things.

We just moved into a rental apartment leaving Rainbow Village. Its been a memorable and happy ~3 years at Rainbow Village. The 2 bedroom apartment had a good balance of convenience and luxury. I will miss the view from the living room and the good people in the building who helped, cared and supported us while we called it our home. The Lin family has played a major role in our lives so far and will continue to do so. We continue along our journey hoping that the next residence we settle in will be worth leaving the comfort, convenience and luxury of Rainbow Village.

While my two favourites did make it to the final. The only song that stayed with me is "Leave Right Now" by Will Young (winner of 2002 Pop Idol). His song would play week after week when contestants are voted out and they show a video of their "journey". He also performed at the finale which prompted me to buy the song from iTunes!

Its just my taste I guess. Or maybe, the live versions you hear on TV does not sound as good as studio recorded songs. I will look up the performances in iTunes later. I might like some enough to buy them.

Along with ending of American Idol 2010, my other favourite TV show 24 also ended. That should free up a lot of time for me in the summer.

Aiden is learning his A, B, C... now. To test him and help him practise, I often ask him to spell words we see.

The other night, we had ice wine with dinner. The one we had was made by Magnotta. Pointing at the wine packaging, I asked Aiden to spell the word 'MAGNOTTA' (he has only learnt upper case). He goes 'M', 'A', 'G' (I was impressed as I had half expected 'C'), 'N', 'O', 'T', 'T', 'A' and then he says 'beer'!

This is typical of him where he associates all wine and alcoholic looking bottles with 'beer'. Another case, he spelled MONOPOLY correctly but pronounced it as McDonalds (we got the board game at McDonalds and it had the M logo and colour scheme).

As with previous Ubuntu releases, I downloaded 11.04 releases yesterday to try it out. I followed instruction and created a USB boot disk with 700MB of 'disk' space for session persistence.

So far, I am very impressed. With every release, Ubuntu is getting closer and closer to being an alternative to Microsoft Windows as a consumer desktop OS. I believe it is already as good as Microsoft Windows for business.

1) Skype
I remember having to do a lot of tweaking to get Skype voice call to work in previous Ubuntu releases. The last time I tried Ubuntu, Skype did not have video calling or screen sharing. So I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to install Skype and have video and voice working flawlessly without any tweak! I did not get a chance to try screen sharing yet but I don't expect any problem with it.

2) UI
I like the UI of the Ubuntu 11.04. Overall, it feels minimalist compared to Microsoft Windows. No thick border around all application windows. Love it! The default scroll bars look good as well.

3) Application install
The new Ubuntu Software Center is very user friendly and the overall application install experience is good.

This is exciting. I will use it as an OS on the laptop and see how long I can go without moving back into Microsoft Windows.

Today, on the 3rd day of trying, Aiden was able to cycle himself on two wheels. On the 2nd day, he was able to balance a little which was encouraging but was not able to pedal and ride by himself. He was able to ride by himself about 30 feet towards the end of today's attempt. Caroline and I enjoyed watching him balance and pedal by himself first a little bit and then a little more and more. We are both proud of him for achieving this small but significant milestone in his life. I still remember the first day he wanted to try without the side training wheels and struggled a lot eventually giving up. When he finished, he told me to put the training wheels back on and did not seem happy when I said it cannot be put back on and that he cannot give up and have to try and try again. On the 2nd day (after a gap of few days) he was willing to try again without the training wheels and  I remember him telling me many times that he cannot give up. Although he did struggle again, he was able to go very short distances by himself and balance a little. While I could see him improving, it came as a pleasant surprise to me today when he finally got it.

Look forward to cycling with him soon around the neighbourhood.

Yesterday, I was at the India Visa office to collect my passport. As one would expect, the majority of people in the office at the time were Indians and also as expected, everyone was wearing typical winter clothes: down jackets, sport jackets, coats etc. In short, the clothing was typical western winter wear. But there was one lady that was stood out. She was wearing a sari, Indian jewellery like bangles, rings and even had a nose stud that is common in India. There were about 30 people in the office including staff but she was the only one who was not wearing typical western winter attire. But that is not the interesting part. The interesting part is she was a white lady! So, in an India visa office filled with brown people wearing typical western winter wear, there was this one white lady wearing traditional Indian clothes and jewellery. What an inversion!

Here are some comments on Sherwood 6' X 8' Garden Shed from Home Depot (Price: $699 + Base will cost another $200 or so)

More details at
<a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/product/sherwood-6-x-8-garden-shed/934835">http://www.homedepot.ca/product/sherwood-6-x-8-garden-shed/934835</a>

* Don't use the included deck wood. They are soft and curved and not well treated. Instead buy Pressure Treated 2x4 or 2x6 from Home Depot or other stores.
* Don't use the included nails for the decking. It does not hold well. Use decking screws instead.
* In general, consider using screws throughout instead of nails especially where you are unsure if things will fit properly or not (all walls). Nails are not easy to take out if you have to readjust and it could damage the sheathing. We used screws for the corners. When we were sure of the fit and square, we used nails for the rest. 
* Use a lot of braces to ensure walls are square.
* Follow instructions carefully and in order.
* Pay attention to the offsets. The offsets are essential. We put the front and back walls flush ignoring the offset and spent a lot of time redoing it mainly due to the nails. Hence, the above advise on using screws.

Time to build: 1 day
Manpower: 1 professional, 1 professional who doesn't do it for a living and two unskilled helpers. I am one of the two unskilled helpers.

Sherwood Shed is well designed and the materials and instructions are good. The price is also reasonable. I would recommend it.

<p>My car radio plays 99.1 and keeps me informed and entertained on my drives short and long (via podcasting). My weekday routine involves a short morning drive and a short evening drive. <a title="Metro Morning" href="http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/">Metro Morning</a> keeps me informed about the city(news, events and traffic) in the morning including refreshing music(often local). My evening drive is filled with smiles and intellectual stimulation thanks to <a title="As It Happens" href="http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/">As It Happens</a>. It is a news program with a clever twist. Often, I would hear something interesting or moving and replay like the one about a <a title="Talking Pig" href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/AudioMobile/As%2BIt%2BHappens/ID/2400994489/">talking pig called Mouse</a> or read more at their website like the show about the <a title="As It Happens Remixed" href="http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/remixed/">new theme music</a>.

Vinyl Cafe needs no introduction. I could go on about it for a very long time because it is story telling at it's best. The introductory piece in the program takes me to places in Canada I have not been to, giving me history and comments in a way only <a title="Stuart McLean" href="http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/about.php">Stuart McLean</a> can: factual, entertaining, opinionated and funny. The musical guests entertains us between different segments (introduction, letters and story). The letters from listeners of the show tells us remarkable stories that are original and private of ordinary people, the kind we usually tell over dinner or on the bus but it gets lost in time and not shared. The Pièce de résistance of the show is the story about Dave. Once a week, Stuart McLean reads us a story about misadventures of the main character Dave. Dave has a wife Morley, children Stephanie and Sam, a family dog Arthur and "friendly" neighbours (Mary Turlington is the most interesting one). The motto of Dave's store - and of the radio show - is "We May Not Be Big, But We're Small"!</p><p>Enough said, please go listen to the past stories at <a title="CBC Vinyl Cafe Podcast" href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/arts-culture/vinyl-cafe-stories/">CBC podcasts</a> or check out <a title="How to listen to Vinyl Cafe" href="http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/listen.php">other options</a>.

It is unfortunate that Rob Ford could be relected Mayor of Toronto in the Oct'14 elections.

<h3>Why is it unfortunate?</h3>

Would I trust him with decisions for the City of Toronto when he has demonstrated publicly his inability to filter out nonsense and lies?

The Mayor or Toronto is expected to lead counsillors, city staff and the people of the city in general but the way he handled Toronto Star's report on the video showing him smoking what appears to be crack(which he admitted after Police found the video) and subsequent embarrasements followed by (see References below) does not give me confidence that he will do a good job.

<h3>If not Rob Ford, then who?</h3>

Election day is 10 months away but if I had to vote today, I would vote for Karen Stintz because she is the only one among the declared candidates that I know of and it is more "No Rob Ford" than "Yes Karen Stintz" that is driving my thinking.

One thing is clear: If we don't have a popular single alternative to Rob Ford, then the "No Rob Ford" votes would split and he could end up with the most votes and get re-elected. That would be sad.

So, in the next 10 months leading to election day, I intend to educate myself about the candidates that are up for Mayor and a) make up my mind about who I will vote for and b) pass on information to others and help them make up their minds.

Kids. I often look at others who have grown up kids and wonder when will mine grow up so they are not as dependent on me as they are now. As with anything, I am only looking at the half glass full. The idea that I can leave them behind at home by themselves or they can go to other places by themselves seem very appealing. Think about all the freedom and time I will have!

But I am often also told that the age my kids are in is the best by parents with teenage or older kids. I still remember a fellow passenger telling me that he still remembers one summer day he spent with his daugher who was 2-3 years at the time (his daughter goes to university now). As he was telling me, I can see him get lost in nostalgia reliving that day for a little bit in his mind. He was all smiles and happy and I can see he would not mind going back to that time at all.

I am there now.

Tomorrow, I volunteered to cook Chicken Curry for the gathering with friendly neighbours. I don't remember cooking Chicken Curry before although I have a general idea of the steps involved(having assisted the wife several times). I have two options before me. Consult the wife for her recipe or look it up on the internet. Since this is suppose to be independently cooked, I will use <a href="http://youtu.be/NRovp9c9e-4" title="chicken currry">Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana's recipe</a> from YouTube and run it by my wife to see what she thinks. She is an experienced and well reviewed cook, so I would not be surprised if she is not excited with my decision to go with this and not her tried and well reviewed recipe.

It would be more of a challenge and potentially more of a surprise to everyone if I try something different. Let's see how it turns out.

Update(Dec 28th 2.23am ET): While I did not follow all the steps accurately(over grated onions, did not cook tomato properly, mixed onion, garlic and ginger paste together), I did use the ingredients and for the most part, what I cooked was from this recipe so the recipe and the video deserves credit for the good biased reviews I got. Will definitely retry this and follow the steps more accurately the next time.

Many websites are promoting learning to code/program a computer and strangely several politicians have said they will learn it and encourage the public to learn it as well.

Coding/programming is <em>not</em> for the general public just like diagnosing an illness or defending a case in the court or fixing a car engine. Just because we use computers and the internet a lot does not mean we need to learn how computer programs are made. Learning to avoid computer virus, theft or misuse of their data is for the general public but not coding.

Above links to an article about the Director of UK government's "Year of Code" initiative. She does not know how to code herself, she says things like "code is an international language", "I think you can pick it up in a day" to show her ignorance.

Politicians or politically connected getting a job they know nothing about is old news but this topic is close to me so wanted to share my thoughts.

Will I teach my kids how to code/program computer? Maybe. If they have an interest and if it is part of their school curriculum but not because they need it or they will get a good job or make a lot of money.

What I would force them to learn? cooking, swimming, doing nothing and being bored ;-)

Linux <code>find</code> command ignores* name (dash name) option and runs finding all files instead of exiting with an unknown parameter error.

Sybase's processing of a where clause in a derived table confused me. Instead of applying it first, it seemed to move the where clause outside of the derived table. To recreate the behaviour, here is a table with two rows:

<code>create table data(nums varchar(4))
insert into data values('255')
insert into data values('3000')

select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu
from data
where len(nums) &lt; 4 -- filter out 3000
) inside
where nu = 255
</code>

What I expect: 255

What happens:
Query throws Arithmetic overflow error during conversion of '3000' to tinyint(range is 0-255). I expected the filter in the derived table to be applied first eliminating '3000' from getting converted but that is not the case. It seems Sybase does below instead:

<code>select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu, nums
from data
) inside
where nu = 255
and len(nums) &lt; 4</code>

I could not find out why so this remains a mystery but what makes it more interesting is below works fine:

<code>select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu
from data
where nums != '3000'
) inside
where nu = 255
</code>

We used a temporary table to ensure filter happens.

Eight years ago, I subscribed to daily Toronto Star newspaper. I still remember that evening... A lady with a small table full of Toronto Star newspapers greeted us at the lobby of the apartment. She offered $1/week subscription plus a gift and I was sold. I got a chess set (pieces were plastic but looked like glass) and years of great news, opinions, knowledge and recommendations. I enjoyed reading Toronto Star and still do.

There were phases where I would read a lot of it daily, and then there were also weeks it went unread. For over a year now, since I got the iPad, the paper goes straight into the recycle bin more than to the breakfast table or the bathroom (my favourite reading place). Many times, I have considered cancelling it but changed my mind. I still read Toronto Star, but more using the computer or iPad.

The reading experience on computer or iPad is not as good as the printed version but the amount of unread paper I put into the recycle bin makes me feel guilty. So this week, I finally cancelled the subscription to the Toronto Star newspaper. Instead, I opted for monthly Digital Access subscription that gives full access to thestar.com including a Replica Edition (digital version of the newspaper).

I am buying or borrowing eBooks more than paper versions as well. There is a practical convenience to digital reading but I cannot help but feel sad about the trend away from printed paper. This feels more like a good bye to an old friend than anything else.

A friends Acer laptop was slow and she asked me to look into it. The approach I took is similar to the one for <a title="Asus laptop cleanup" href="http://richardhsu.net/2012/01/10/removing-useless-preloaded-applications-from-asus-laptop/">Asus</a> but since this was Acer, I had to do research on Acer specific bloatware/crapware.

Microsoft sells computers with the <a title="Microsoft Signature Experience" href="https://signature.microsoft.com">Signature Experience</a>" that comes without any bloatware/crapware (what they call 'junk ware'/'trialware'). If you are buying a new Windows computer, I recommend <a title="Microsoft Store" href="http://content.microsoftstore.com/en-us/Home.aspx">Microsoft Store</a>.

Below is a partial summary of work done to get Windows 7 working responsively again.

Work done:
Reset Internet Explorer
Reset Google Chrome
Make Google Chrome default
Setup Power button to Hibernate instead of Shutdown (to reduce startup time)

Removed:
Acer Backup Manager
Bing Bar
Rogers Online Protection (subscription service)
Rogers Servicepoint Agent
Norton Online Backup
MyWinLocker Suite
Acer Registration
eBay

Installed:
Microsoft Security Essentials &amp; run a Quick scan.

Finally, I reviewed logs and investigated and resolved the errors. One of these was a DHCP error which was causing the Wireless connections at startup to run very slow. I disabled the unused Intel Wireless Display network components and this was resolved.

What I started but could not complete:
<a title="Spinrite" href="https://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm">Spinrite</a> maintenance (would have taken days to scan 700GB)

What I should have done but missed:

Few weeks ago, I was walking around in downtown Tlaquepaque(Mexico) with Enrique and SJ. Outdoor weather was good, there were many others walking around and enjoying the evening. We walked past a coffee shop that had a lady singer and two guys on guitars performing outside. At first, my attention went to the singer who was singing an english song without any microphone. Her voice was powerful and you could hear it clearly 50 steps away. She finished her song and was taking a break, we continued walking and then I heard the guy on electric guitar play the SpongeBob squarepants <a title="SpongeBob squarepants background tune" href="http://youtu.be/-FlzPSbvY14">background tune</a>. I recognised it right away, turned around and noticed the guitar player smiling while he was playing it. He was having fun and I had a smile too thanks to him. My young friends walking with me did not recognise it (they dont have kids yet) so I educated them about SpongeBob.

At this point, what I should have done is walked back to the guitar player and let him know that I got it, that what he did just now meant something to me, it made me smile, it made me think of my kids (especially my son who watched a lot of SpongeBob), that the already nice evening I was having got nicer because of it but I kept on walking on. Very un-cool of me.

Dec 22, 2013 (midnight)

For all day today, we did not have electricity at home due to power outage caused by icy weather conditions. It was a unique experience for us, having long forgotten what it is like not to have electricity and all that it enables.

Fortunately, we had gas so we could have breakfast and coffee to start the day but soon after that, we headed out to the mall where we expected all things under one roof. Electricity, food, shopping and generally suited for passing hours of our day till, what we hoped for, the evening when power would get restored at home.

As it was a wide spread power outage in the city, we soon learned that it would take as long as 72 hours for power to get restored to over 250,000 houses that lost power in Toronto. We also heard of the possibility of emergency being called if things got worse (not sure what it means though).

Tired from sitting and doing nothing in the mall, we decided to get back home. To our pleasant surprise, the temperature inside was a liveable 16 degrees Celsius while it was about 2 degrees outside. The rest of the evening was spent with the pleasure of the company of our friendly neighbours and candle light dinner.

As I write this, I hear a generator running outside but see all dark. It has been fun experiencing a day without power but I look forward to going back to the normal (miss the TV and Internet already).

On my way home from the airport, I like to have conversations with the cab driver. It usually starts with the weather and then move to topics that includes current events. Weather was still cold and we both agreed we had enough of the winter already. In current news, the driver told me about a case of shooting in Brampton court house. That led to a long conversation about possible motives factoring in stressful lifestyle and isolation of new immigrants. We were about 5 minutes away from home when I learnt the driver had 3 teenage boys. I asked him how he kept them out of trouble. He started with "I will give you an idea that is guaranteed to work".

Expecting another long and interesting conversation, I wished we had more time but it turned out his idea was simple and short. Put them into daily Karate classes he said. All his boys have Black Belt, are studying well and behave well. According to him, boys have a lot of energy and time and if you keep them occupied with something that will expend both, at the end of the day, they will be tired and have less time to get into mischief. All they do is go home, eat and sleep. He repeated that it was a guaranteed solution and I should follow it.

I reached home, we shook hands and said our good byes. Not being a fan of learning martial arts, I don't plan to follow his advice with my kids but I do agree they need daily physical activity. My way involves playing ball hockey, swimming, basketball or running around chasing others wildly.

I got my <a href="http://www.kobo.com/kobotouch" title="Kobo Touch">Kobo Touch</a> the first day it was available in stores (June 2011). At that time, options for reading included paper books, newspaper, magazines, 22" desktop or 15" notebook computer displays. Reading email and blogs on computer screens were fine but reading articles or books were not as pleasant as paper books for two reasons: backlit displays made my eyes blurry and portability. A device the size &amp; weight of a pocket reference book that can hold thousands of books, reads like print on paper (<a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/tequila/dp/eink-text._V139457038_.jpg" title="E Ink vs. Paper vs. LCD">almost</a>), can download anything in the Kobo bookstore wirelessly in minutes and does not need to be recharged for weeks was a welcome change and a new curiosity.

The first book I downloaded in Kobo Touch was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes" (free). Digital edition of Newspapers were tried but clumsy navigation and $15/month subscription did not win me over so I stopped after the free trial period. The wife reads more, so she monopolised it and quickly learnt to find and download free eBooks. The first book I read start to finish was Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. I remember browsing through the thick and heavy hardcover edition at the bookstore and deciding on the eBook instead. The ability to lookup meaning of words with a touch makes for a more complete understanding of the writer.

With wireless internet connection, it was convenient to get books from Kobos bookstore into Kobo Touch but content from other sources (blogs, websites, Toronto Public Library) required a cable connection to a computer<sup id="fnref-658-1"><a href="#fn-658-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Typically, Kobo Touch and the computer would be at extreme opposite sides of the house so walking to the computer in the basement, finding the USB cable, plugging in the Kobo Touch, finding the eBook or pdf I wanted to read and copying it into the Kobo Touch was a labour intensive process. Another problem was books with photos. Since Kobo Touch was monochrome and low resolution, photos did not show as intended unless the eBook was made specifically for the device.

Like the Kobo Touch, I ordered iPad 3 as soon as it was released (Mar 2012). So nine months after Kobo Touch, iPad usurped the role of notebook and Kobo Touch swiftly for the wife. It helped that you had access to Kobo bookstore plus Amazons via their iPad apps and photos are vibrant and detailed and text crisp and clear. Apples iBook would later replace both Kobo and Amazons bookstore apps for the wife and kids cutting off all links to Kobo. I continued to use Kobo Touch and Kobo applications on the iPad and computers to buy and read books but the usage of Kobo Touch decreased in favour of the iPad at home.

It is perfect for use away for home (travel, kid's soccer practice): fits in the pocket, has more books than I can read, holds charge for weeks, no problem reading in bright ambient light and dont have to handle with care. Cannot say the same for iPad.

Since August 2013, Kobo has integration with Pocket so I can save web content for reading in Kobo Touch as well. It also has Chess and Sudoku but I dont play them. The best available Kobo E Ink device today is <a href="http://www.kobo.com/koboaurahd" title="Kobo Aura HD">Kobo Aura HD</a>. I have tried it at a nearby Chapters store and agree it is the '<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2417797,00.asp" title="Porsche of eReaders">Porsche of eReaders</a>'. It has front lighting for reading in the dark, smoother page turns and text looks as sharp and clear as those on paper. Will wait for the price to drop below its Porsche level ($170).

While writing this blog, I learnt through <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=192545" title="Kobo Web Broswer">unofficial sources</a> that Kobo Touchs experimental web browser can be used to download books from the internet. The browser is a pain to use (pages dont render well, touch typing is difficult) so the finding of things to read is not practical but I can find it at the computer, save the file at a location with a short address (e.g. http://example.com/reads/) and then type it in the Kobo Touch web browser to download it. This eliminates the cable transfer. The ideal solution would be Kobo making this easier with their one touch sync but I don't expect this to be a priority. Like Amazon, Kobos E Ink devices are probably sold at a loss, they make money through books sold.&#160;<a href="#fnref-658-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Which Ikea umbrella is better for the backyard? <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70260320/">SEGLARÖ</a> or <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10260295/">KARLSÖ</a> ?

A month ago, the wife and I started looking for outdoor furniture and umbrella for the backyard. Ikea (our favourite) was the first place we went shopping. At Ikea, they had this nice demo area with all the umbrellas and furnitures on display and our attention went to the big rectangular hanging umbrella called SEGLARÖ and the dark brown acacia wood <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/14213/">ÄPPLARÖ</a> sofa set underneath. I could imagine myself relaxing in the backyard sitting in the sofa shaded by the umbrella.

There was some hesitation about the sofa so we wanted to check other stores but the three member shopping team (wife, mother-in-law and I) were in agreement to buy the SEGLARÖ umbrella as it had the design (cantilever) and size (~11' X 8') we wanted and the price ($189) was within expectations (why we like Ikea). Since we had the whole family at the time, I did not think the umbrella would fit in the car, so decided to return another time for it.

I talked about the umbrella with my neighbour and he liked it too so we had planned to go to Ikea together. Weeks past but we didn't. Others did and SEGLARÖ umbrellas sold out across Canada! <sup id="fnref-679-1"><a href="#fn-679-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

Both of us got earfuls from our respective wives for our procrastination. I blamed him and the continuous rain and he blamed me and we both attempted to make it look like we had all the intentions but nature and miscommunication was the reason we missed the 'perfect' umbrella.

After visiting many stores over weeks, we went back to Ikea and bought the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/14213/">ÄPPLARÖ</a> sofa set and <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10260295/">KARLSÖ</a> umbrella. KARLSÖ is also a cantilevered/hanging umbrella but different from <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70260320/">SEGLARÖ</a>.

Comparison of the two umbrellas:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th></th><th>Shape</th><th>Coverage</th><th>Pole</th><th>Price</th><th>Turn</th><th>Tilt</th></tr>
<tr><th>SEGLARÖ</th>
<td>Rectangle</td><td>85 sq ft</td><td>Aluminum</td><td>C$ 189</td><td>Yes (360 &deg;)</td><td>Yes</td></th>
</tr>
<tr><th>KARLSÖ</th>
<td>Circle</td><td>76 sq ft</td><td>Steel</td><td>C$ 89</td><td>No</td><td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Why pay $100 more for SEGLARÖ?
* It can be turned (360 &deg;) to shade different areas. <sup id="fnref-679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
* Tilt function; provides protection from the sun all day long. <sup id="fnref2:679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
* The pole is made of aluminium so it wont rust. <sup id="fnref3:679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
* 9 sq ft more coverage (enough for a chair)
* Rectangle is better than circle as the seating arrangements tend to be rectangular.
* Better build quality overall

Comparison of size:

This is a view from the top of the two umbrellas (SEGLARÖ is the rectangle, KARLSÖ the round one). I have put three 2' X 2' chairs to show what would fit in the non-overlapping areas. SEGLARÖ covers a little more but not by as much as we had expected (based on our visual estimates).

If both were available, I would have bought SEGLARÖ for the features but KARLSÖ delivers better value. Two KARLSÖs would still cost lesser than one SEGLARÖ and cover about twice the area. I did buy two but one is adequate for the ÄPPLARÖ seating we have. I wish it moved easily like SEGLARÖ to shade the entire seating area (the shade moves with the sun) but the $100 saved comforts me.

On the way to my son's soccer practise this morning, I heard about the ugly side of soccer (or football) on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/essays/2014/06/15/fifa-football-frenzy-unmasked/" title="FIFA Football Frenzy, Unmasked">cbc Radio One</a>. Stories about a referee stabbing an arguing player to death, then himself getting beheaded by outraged fans in a Brazilian town a year ago, 21 people killed in riots after a playoff loss in Democratic Republic of Congo last month, gunfights at a Buenos Aires stadium and 'plentiful and growing' corruption charges against FIFA.

<blockquote>
  It is ironic that such a boring athletic contest
  could lead to such violence and fanatical behaviour
</blockquote>

Said the host of the radio show making the case for soccer not being '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Game" title="The Beautiful Game">beautiful</a>' anymore.

Having played soccer in my school years and followed the European leagues and World Cups, I don't agree the game is boring to watch or play but I agree it is not worth the violence. Soccer games, as with anything else, can be an excuse for violence or money making.

At my son's soccer practise where kids between 6 to 12 years old play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal" title="Futsal">indoors</a>, what I saw was 'beautiful'. The shouting of "give it to me!", "oooh", "aaah", the goal celebrations, the funny misses that gets everyone laughing, the drama (a kid was celebrating his sister's goal against his team!) expressed the fun, passion and excitement of playing the game for its own sake. It was just as entertaining as the games on TV.

Even in a small group of kids, I saw unique styles. There is a spectacled boy who shoots with great power. I volunteered for goalie last Sunday and dreaded the sight of him with the ball and an open shot at me. Another boy (bigger than the rest) plays like a bulldozer, he moves slow but no one can stop him and he spends large durations in the sidelines resting. The best player is the coach's protege. He is an all round player: controls the ball well, passes well and shoots with precision. I did not see him play for 2 days and missed it like a fan. The boys and girls play hard and argue just like men do but they laugh and fool around too unlike televised competition games. I have my <a href="http://richardhsu.net/2014/05/19/e-ink/" title="Kobo eReader">Kobo eReader</a> or a book with me at soccer practise but only read it when the kids are doing exercises. As soon as the games begin, my attention shifts to it and I cannot help myself but get involved. I shout "shoot", applause when a goal is scored and make funny facial expressions when there is a near miss.

My son plays defence with no interest in scoring or shooting at goal but he scored one today and I saw him smile with pride and joy as his team mates hi-fived him and patted him on his back.

Ah yes, the beautiful game.

There are two things I like about Sunday mass: The music and stories (homily/sermon). Here is one Father Galea told last Sunday. I don't remember the exact words so this is an adapted version.

A man asks a boy "what do you want to be when you grow up?". He answers "a junk collector". Surprised at the answer, then disappointed but not curious at all, the man gets ready to give unsolicited advice about life choices. He is about to tell the boy why he should be anything <em>but</em> a junk collector when the boy asks "so what have you done?". The man is quiet, thinks and then realises everything he has collected is <em>junk</em>.

Father gave an example of J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the "father of the atomic bomb", a bright scientist who spent years leading a team developing weapons of mass destruction. When the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945, his thoughts were "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.". He would later oppose the use of nuclear weapons. Perhaps, all he considered valuable wasn't so?

I thought about the answer to "so what have you done?". Difficult one.

"Look for treasures in life, not junk", advised Father Galea. How to tell them apart? To help answer this question, you should think about death said Father. It will give a better perspective on life and what is a treasure, what is junk. My own views on this changes with time. My favourites on the subject of death and purpose of life are <a href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html" title="How to Do What You Love">How to Do What You Love by Paul Graham</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc" title="Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address">Steve Job's commencement address</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/ncoSRKoU6GQ" title="The Last Lecture by Dr Randy Pausch">The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch</a><sup id="fnref-707-1"><a href="#fn-707-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/empathy/" title="Empathy">Empathy by Matt Gemmell</a>.

Things I tell myself and others (when they ask):
* Laugh at yourself
* Don't worry about money or prestige
* Stay hungry, stay foolish
* Have fun all the time
* Don't complain; just work harder

This happens often. At a restaurant, grocery or mall, my son will ask me if he can go pee-pee. I will show him the way to the washroom and wait outside, after doing his business, he will come out and I will ask if he washed his hands. He will smile and go back to the washroom again. :) I have not had to ask a second time.

I know what you must be thinking. He is an honest boy ;)

Photography is the only creative thing I do and it has been a hobby for the last 10 years. Here is an equipment centric account of my photographic journey. There is something to be said about my teachers and influences too but that is for another day.

My earliest memory of photography is from Darjeeling, a hill station in India close to Kolkata. My two brothers and I had a good time on that trip (chilling water baths, seeing snow covered Mount Kanchenjunga on the last day of our trip). I borrowed a film camera and bought a tripod for the trip. Don't know where the photos are now but I remember using the tripod to make a photo of us three at the Rock garden. It was a heavy metal tripod that didn't get reused and was eventually disposed. That trip was perhaps the first time I ever used a camera.

Fast forward to 2004. I got a job that required me to travel. The income from that job and travelling encouraged me to buy my first camera. An entry level 2 megapixel <a href="https://flic.kr/p/7h56g" title="Kodak Digital Camera">Kodak digital camera</a>. The first photo was made in a taxi (digital fare meter). That camera was useful and I had it in Kerala, later in my work trip to Ghana and eventually, it came with me to Canada. The photos made with it takes me back in time and I revisit the places and moments in Kerala and Ghana (Thank you Biju).

On the way to Canada, my wife and I stopped over in Germany for a week to meet her uncle. He had a Casio QV-R51 digital camera that was slimmer and better camera overall compared to my Kodak (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardhsu/tags/wolfsburg/" title="Wolfsburg, Germany">Wolfsburg photos</a>). When I landed in Canada, I continued to use my Kodak but soon replaced it with 5 megapixel Canon Powershot A610 digital camera. I paid around $500 (lower end at the time). The image quality was much improved and at par with the Casio I had tried. I got into photography more seriously, learning about technical aspects of photography, following photography websites (Flickr, photo.net, Ken Rockwell) often planning ahead for a <a href="https://flic.kr/p/8QUVt" title="CN Tower">photo</a>. The Canon Powershot is a capable camera with features like <a href="https://flic.kr/p/8eEef" title="Nathan Phillip Square at night">long exposure</a> and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/79xusm" title="Fall">macro photos</a>. I have photos and videos of my son as a baby and toddler made with it. Precious memories that I shared with my family and friends near and far. The camera and internet reduced the vast distance between us. They still bring a smile when I view them from time to time. Nice camera. I still have it but it is out of use.

After using Canon Powershot for many years, it was time to upgrade to a Digital SLR (DSLR), I was hoping DSLR prices would drop below <a href="http://richardhsu.net/2007/01/15/year-2007-resolutions/" title="Wish List">$500</a> but ran out of patience. Trusting the recommendation of <a href="http://kenrockwell.com" title="Ken Rockwell">Ken Rockwell</a>, I bought a used Nikon D40 body from Henrys for $250 and matched it with a Nikon 35/f1.8 prime lens from Futureshop. Sometime later, I added an external flash (SB 400) for bouncing light from the ceiling (to avoid the harsh white light on the face). I still have this kit today.

The DSLR difference? bokeh, detail, low light and fast.

Bokeh
With the 35mm lens, I could control what and how much was in focus (bokeh). This is the No. 1 reason I wanted a DSLR. The photos with <a href="https://flic.kr/p/eCoWnG" title="Butterfly">blurred out background</a> is more pleasing. With my Canon Powershot, the only way I could get some bokeh was with macro photos. For portraits or any subject farther than an arms length, I would not get any bokeh. With the 35mm lens on the D40 DSLR, I had much more control, enough to make a portrait photo that had the eyes in focus but the ears are blurred!

Detail
The D40 has a bigger sensor so it captures more details. Detail matter when we make prints or zoom into it. The difference in megapixel (MP) between the two cameras is just 1 MP but the difference in detail is much more. Megapixel is not a good attribute for comparing cameras. Today's camera phones have more than 6 MP but the photos will not print as clear as my D40. With more detail, the image remains sharp even after cropping. I don't make large prints so don't yet know the limits of the D40's 6 MP images. Most entry level DSLRs today are 10 MP or more so that is one reason to upgrade :).

Low light
In low light it is difficult to get sharp, well lit images with Point &amp; Shoot cameras like my Canon Powershot. The only solution is to use flash but you get unpleasing results due to harsh white light on the foreground subject and dark background. To show the background, there is a "Night Snapshot" option but due to longer exposure, if the foreground subjects are not still, they will show up slightly blurred.

The D40 can make sharp, well lit photos without a flash in <a href="https://flic.kr/p/9fAmDW" title="Tiramisu">low light</a> (Higher ISO, larger aperture) and with an external flash like my SB400 pointing at the ceiling, you get even better color and more detail. I plan to buy a better flash (SB600 or SB700) that will give me off camera flash and more creative lighting options.

Fast
Due to the mechanics of the DSLR, there is no delay between pressing the shutter release button and the capture of the image. This means less retakes. Also, it increases the chances of getting a sharp photo of moving subjects (like children). I typically use continuous shutter for <a href="https://flic.kr/p/fC9986" title="Diabolo">moving subjects</a> (5 images in 2 seconds) to ensure I get a sharp photo. The Canon Powershot is much slower even in daylight.

Video
One thing my 2006 D40 cannot do is make video (current generation entry levels can) so I had to buy another camera. Again, going with Ken Rockwell's recommendation, I bought a slim, pocketable Canon Powershot SD780 that makes videos and photos. We gave this camera away and replaced it with another slim pocket sized Canon Powershot (300HS). It is adequate as a video camera but its image quality is poor even compared to the SD780 (not sure if it is my unit or the model in general). I make more videos with the iPad than with this camera so its days are numbered.

I have made thousands of photos with D40. The majority of them are of my kids.  It is still the only creative hobby I have and enjoy but I seldom carry it outside and hardly ever take it to some place just to make a photo. The need to make photos of events and people will remain but I don't know if I will get back into photography as a creative hobby.

I have decided to migrate the blog from Wordpress to Octopress (hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>) . To get Octopress working, I followed the instructions on the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress website</a> and it worked. The default Classic theme is nice but two customizations were made: Favicon &amp; Date format (remove Time part).

<h3>Favicon</h3>

The default Favicon is nice but I prefer my own Gif image designed by <a href="http://robbyhsu.tumblr.com">Robert</a>.

1) Replace favicon file<br />
I deleted <code>favicon.png</code> from <code>octopress/.themes/classic/source</code> and <code>octopress/source</code> and replaced it with <code>favicon.gif</code>

2) Update <code>head.html</code> in <code>source</code> and <code>theme</code> directories<br />
Files:<br />
<code>source/_includes/head.html</code><br />
<code>octopress/.themes/classic/source</code>

Original:<br />
&lt;link href="{{ root_url }}/favicon.png" rel="icon"&gt;

New:<br />
&lt;link href="{{ root_url }}/favicon.gif" rel="icon"&gt;

<h3>Date format (remove Time part)</h3>

By default, the blog posts will show Date and Time. I removed the Time part.

Files:<br />
<code>octopress/.themes/classic/source/_includes/post/date.html</code><br />
<code>octopress/source/_includes/post/date.html</code>

Original:

[code lang=text]
{% if page.date %}{% capture time %}{{ page.date_time_html
{% if post.date %}{% capture time %}{{ post.date_time_html
[/code]

New:

[code lang=text]
{% if page.date %}{% capture time %}{{ page.date_text
{% if post.date %}{% capture time %}{{ post.date_text
[/code]

For other date formats refer to https://github.com/octopress/date-format

Why migrate?<br />
1) No Ads (don't want to pay $30/year to go ad free in Wordpress)<br />
2) Customizations (don't want to pay $30/year for ability to change font etc.)
3) The simplicity and benefits of static web pages
4) Octopress is a "A blogging framework for hackers." :)

The Polar Express is a story is about a boy who goes to the North Pole in a magical train. He gets a silver bell from Santa Claus but loses it on his way back. Miraculously, the next morning, it appears again in a box under his Christmas tree. The story ends with the quoted text below:

<blockquote>
  I shook the bell. It made the most beautiful sound my sister and I had ever heard.
  
  But my mother said, "Oh, that's too bad."
  
  "Yes," said my father, "it's broken."
  
  When I'd shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound.
  
  At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.
</blockquote>

From "THE POLAR EXPRESS" (Twentieth Anniversary Edition)

I have read this story many times to my son but I paid attention to the ending only this week. Perhaps, I just didn't hear the bell before?

Picture this. An evening at an outdoor Ice Skating rink. It is around Christmas time so the mood is festive and warm. People in their winter coats, jackets, gloves, hats are skating in circles. You hear giggles, laughs, and talks as they go gracefully around the rink. Some are skating in pairs, holding hands. Then it starts to snow! It is beautiful.

This was something I had only seen in movies and TV shows but yesterday, when my son and I went skating, it was real and it was beautiful. My son said "It's like The Winter Classic" (NHL Ice Hockey game played outdoors are called The Winter Classic).

Jan 26th, 2015.

I am sick again. It has been over 10 days now that I am suffering soar throat, fever, shivering, stuffy nose, and cough. It was the same in last month. After a few days of pain, I saw the doctor, got 10 days of antibiotic medicine and I was better. This time, I tried to fight it but gave up yesterday morning and got another round of antibiotic medicines from the doctor.

When you have soar throat, you have difficulty sleeping, eating, talking, and because you don't sleep well, you can't work and feel drowsy and slow all the time. What is worse than soar throat? Sneezing with soar throat. It causes maximum pain and jangles my brain so much I see stars (yes, like the cartoons). It sucks!

But, I have a caring wife, understanding kids, flexible employer, and excellent healthcare so I can take time off and get well. I am lucky. Others fall sick too,  and many have worse health problems but they may not be as lucky as I am.

Two stories from the past weekend:

<h3>Saturday</h3>

Aiden goes to catechism class on Saturday mornings. He doesn't like catechism classes but he knows he will have to attend and learn just like all the other things he has to by our choice. He complained of headache and nausea when I tried to wake him. He didn't want to get up. It does take effort and few calls to wake him up normally but him complaining of headache or nausea is unusual so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him stay in bed longer and skip the catechism class.

After sometime, he did throw up while in bed and wasn't well for the first half of the day so I felt relieved that I didn't force him to go to the class.

By afternoon, he recovered, played, and ate normally the rest of the day.

<h3>Sunday</h3>

He has swimming lessons on Sunday mornings. He doesn't like swimming either and I would wager he prefers catechism classes to swimming. He didn't want to get up again but this time, he just said he didn't "feel" like swimming. Keeping in mind that he was unwell the previous morning, I did consider letting him go back to sleep but decided otherwise. I made him get up assuming he was just trying to avoid swimming.

When I reached YMCA where he learns to swim, he repeated the same thing. He didn't "feel" like swimming and didn't want to get out of the car. This is unusual<sup id="fnref-777-1"><a href="#fn-777-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I did spend sometime to think about it not sure what to do. The unpleasant image of him throwing up in the pool with 30 others was on my mind. On the other hand, if he was alright but just avoiding swim lessons, then letting him skip would set a bad precedent. He would be encouraged to try the same for other things he disliked.

After maybe a minute or so of thinking while still in the parked car, I decided to make him go. We got out of the car, went up to the pool, and he did his lesson without any issue. He seemed fine (as fine as he normally is at the swimming pool).

He was his usual self the rest of the day: playing, asking for things, watching TV etc.

Two scenarios, two different decisions, both turned out well but I can't honestly say I was confident of either of my decisions. It could both have turned out to be unwise. I don't know for sure what it was that worked. Maybe it was experience, maybe it was instinct, maybe it was the "connection" between a parent and a child, or maybe it was luck. I don't know. I can give countless examples of things I did or said that I regretted later but no one likes a story with a bad ending.

Parenting is an art.

I finished reading The Tunnel of Time (R K Laxman's autobiography). Being a slow reader, it took me months to complete but I enjoyed it. Here is a short description of the book and some excerpts.

The book is deeply personal but also historical (India's Independence, Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency, Bangladesh etc.). You learn about R K Laxman's childhood, his family (including R K Narayan), friends and growing up in Mysore. There are stories about how he got started as a cartoonist, detailed descriptions of his travels, ideas about the human condition, his disciplined approach to creating cartoons, and of course his favourite subject (politicians) as observed by The Common Man. You get to know what he thought about his fellow cartoonists from around the world, real estate, winning various awards (including Ramon Magsaysay), and his family. He ends with his thoughts on his grand daughter.

One remarkable fact is he worked at The Times of India, drawing cartoons for over 50 years sitting at the same table!

Excerpts

On Andaman and Nicobar Islands where he had a vacation:
...giant crabs climbed up the coconut trees, plucked the nuts, climbed down, husked them with their claws, cracked them and noisily ate the kernels!

On Politicians:
Largely politics was the profession of school drop-outs; I observed that politicians were endowed with immense vitality but little intelligence. .... I speculated that politicians were the most durable among the human species. They were tough, impervious to humiliation, failure, defeat, insults, shocks. They led a conscience-free existence hungering eternally for power even when charged with corruption, fraud and murder! For all the travelling they did all over the subcontinent, eating and sleeping at odd hours and shouting themselves hoarse in front of a battery of microphones in heat and dust and sub-zero temperatures, they never suffered from colds, sore throats, fevers or any such maladies that afflicted the common citizen.

Interesting teaser:
But my whole life changed one day because a cat fell into the reservoir situated at the top of the Times of India building.

My book came from India as a gift from my brothers (Thank you Robert &amp; Raymond) but I am sure it will not be hard to buy one.

We were on our way to the dollar store. In November, most houses have Christmas lights and decorations so it makes for an interesting drive. One of the houses had sparkly blue lights that covered the entire front wall. It was without doubt the most interesting Christmas lighting we saw. My son, sitting at the back, said Thats Sick!

My wife and I didnt know what he meant and our first reactions were along the lines of What?!. He then proceeded to educate us on the different levels of <em>Cool</em> . According to him, <em>Sick</em> is few levels above <em>Awesome</em>.

Since this is the season to be generous, I am hereby sharing the new found wisdom with you.

Levels of Cool
1. Cool!
2. Awesome! (Cooler than Cool)
3. RAD! (More than Awesome)
4. Sick! (Highest level of Cool)

I was handed the camera(Canon DSLR with Yongnuo flash) at my friend's birthday dinner last month. I pointed the flash to the ceiling(bounce), set the dial to Aperture Priority and went about making photos. I noticed the shutter speed being calculated was slower than ideal and some photos were blurry. The settings I would have used in my Nikon DSLR wasn't working for this Canon camera and I had trouble adjusting. To get a faster shutter speed, I increased the ISO (maybe to 800) and it seemed better. I kept making photos but was uncomfortable with the results. Towards the end of the birthday party, I changed the mode to Shutter Priority, set Shutter Speed to 1/100 sec, ISO 800 and it solved the exposure problem. I should have done that much earlier.

Yesterday, my friend sent me the first 80 photos and most of them were not properly exposed due to slow shutter speed. I could see ghosting, blur, etc. in the photos. It was disappointing and heart breaking. I was trusted to document an important once-in-a-lifetime event in my friend's life and I failed. I am yet to receive the photos made towards the end when I switched to Shutter Priority. Let's hope there is enough in there to make it memorable for him.

I must have viewed countless hours of video, books etc. that covers exposure and the role Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO plays. Yet, when it mattered, I forgot the basics and took too long to get the right exposure and wasted important moments.

Next time, I will remember to set the ISO higher and start with Shutter Priority in that kind of a situation.

My daughter reached an important milestone today. She was allowed entry into Ikea's children's play place called Småland. Ikea shoppers can leave their kids in the supervised play place for 40 minutes at a time. The play place has toys, movies, sponge balls etc. that keep the kids entertained while their parents/guardians shop in peace. My older son has played at the play place every time we have shopped at Ikea over the years.

Since the facility is designed for a certain age group, there is a minimum and maximum height requirement for entry. Few months ago, my daughter was shorter than the minimum height requirement and wasn't allowed to play in there. She was disappointed but I told her if she ate lots of food, she would grow the few inches she needed to get in. Today, we were shopping at Ikea again so I took her to the play place. The entry supervisor asked her to take her shoes off and stand against the measurement wall. To our pleasant surprise, the top of her head was just touching the line marking the minimum height and they let her in!

This marks a small but significant milestone in her life and ours. We don't weigh or measure our children's height so it is these simple and small life events that makes us pause and think about their growth.

Another funny story related to my daughter happened last night. I was dressed and ready to go out when I realised the cell phone wasn't in my pocket. Thinking it was upstairs in my office room, I asked my daughter to go get it for me. She could not find it(it was in my jacket pocket) but came back with the cordless phone handset. She said she couldn't find my cell phone so I should have the cordless phone instead.

The Samsung 50" TV stopped working Thursday night. No TV on Friday meant the general mood at home was a mix of impatience (when are you getting the new TV?), boredom, anxiety (what is happening in Friday's episodes), and excitement (shopping for a new gadget and reading reviews). After eliminating the power cable as the problem for the dead TV, I decided it wasn't worth repairing and so began the search for a new TV.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li>The dead TV was a budget model so it had only 2 HDMI ports. Since I had more than 2 HDMI devices, I bought a HDMI splitter that expands 2 HDMI ports to 4. So any TV with 2 HDMI ports will suffice.</li>
<li>I use Apple TV for Netflix, YoutTube, etc. so there is no need for the "Smart" apps in the TV itself.</li>
<li>There is a chart that shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_HDTV_viewing_distance">optimal TV screen size</a> for various viewing distances. I looked up the chart and found 50"-55" to be ideal.</li>
<li>Price range: $700-$1200.</li>
</ol>

Since my last two TVs lasted 4 years and 3 years respectively, I wanted to get a 5 years warranty so I didn't have to buy another TV in 5 years. That narrowed down the seller to Costco. Other sellers either charge more for 5 years warranty or can't be relied on for that long.

There are many TVs in the price range of $700-$1200. I narrowed it down to two based on reviews<sup id="fnref-892-1"><a href="#fn-892-1">1</a></sup>, screen size, and some unscientific selection criterias. After considering <a href="http://www.vizio.com/en-ca/m55c2.html">Vizio M-Series 55" LED TV</a>, I decided to buy <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-55LF6000">LG 55" LED TV (Model 55LF6000)</a>. The pros and cons of the Vizio vs. LG are listed below:

<h2>Why Vizio?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Ultra HD/4K</li>
<li>Smart TV</li>
<li>Better build quality</li>
<li>5 HDMI inputs</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why LG?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Costs 37% or $412 lesser ($511 if 5 yrs warranty and taxes are included)</li>
<li>Can't play Ultra HD/4K but I anticipate limited Ultra HD content for the next </li>
<li>few years so I would be viewing 1080p (HD) most of the time anyways, and I doubt the additional resolution and detail would matter to me.</li>
<li>Not a Smart TV, but I don't need it. Apple TV is much better (more apps e.g. Shomi, better designed apps).</li>
<li>LG design and build quality is good. The metallic look is nice. Besides, all I see is the big display, the rest I hardly notice at all.</li>
<li>Only 2 HDMI inputs but I have a splitter already so not an issue for me.</li>
</ol>

<h2>My Review</h2>

After 2 days of cable TV watching, XBox gaming, and movie watching both on Netflix and via USB, I am happy with the TV. Looks great and works fine. I gave it a 5-Stars rating on Costco's website. I just have two minor annoyances with the user interface.

First, when I press volume up/down, even though I don't use the TV's sound, it still shows a round image at the lower center of the screen. This is much better than Samsung's rectangle in the center of the screen but I wish it showed nothing at all. Second, when playing movies from a USB, the movie names are truncated so files with the similar long names are indistinguishable.

<h2>Conspiracy against LG?</h2>

We almost didn't buy it! At Costco, the LG model mentioned above was on display so The Wife and I compared the picture quality with other TVs (including a Vizio M-Series) and to my disappointment, it was not as good as the others. Images were not as sharp and text wasn't smooth (the curve of the letter C looked pixelated). We went back and forth comparing different TVs and came to the same conclusion that the picture looked worst in the LG one. I suspected it had to do with the picture profile settings so I started looking for a Costco employee for help.

There was a gentleman in the next aisle helping another customer so I waited. When I got his attention, I told him about the LG TV picture quality and asked him if he can change the Picture settings to improve it. He said that is how that TV is and there is nothing he can do. He didn't even bother to see it for himself! His reply wasn't satisfactory and I got the impression he didn't know or care so I went back and tried to change the setting myself.

It was awkward since I was reaching above my shoulder height and under the TV to find the control button. I did manage to change the setting from "Vivid" to "Cinema" and the picture quality improved. It looked just as sharp, clear and smooth as the rest of the TVs we were comparing to! With confirmation and agreement with The Wife, I loaded up the TV and headed for the cash counter. There are lessons here about many things and it makes me appreciate all those times when I depended on a knowledgeable and helpful store people.
