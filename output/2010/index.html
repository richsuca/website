<p>Aiden is learning his A, B, C... now. To test him and help him practise, I often ask him to spell words we see.</p>
<p>The other night, we had ice wine with dinner. The one we had was made by Magnotta. Pointing at the wine packaging, I asked Aiden to spell the word 'MAGNOTTA' (he has only learnt upper case). He goes 'M', 'A', 'G' (I was impressed as I had half expected 'C'), 'N', 'O', 'T', 'T', 'A' and then he says 'beer'!</p>
<p>This is typical of him where he associates all wine and alcoholic looking bottles with 'beer'. Another case, he spelled MONOPOLY correctly but pronounced it as McDonalds (we got the board game at McDonalds and it had the M logo and colour scheme).</p>

<p>While my two favourites did make it to the final. The only song that stayed with me is &quot;Leave Right Now&quot; by Will Young (winner of 2002 Pop Idol). His song would play week after week when contestants are voted out and they show a video of their &quot;journey&quot;. He also performed at the finale which prompted me to buy the song from iTunes!</p>
<p>Its just my taste I guess. Or maybe, the live versions you hear on TV does not sound as good as studio recorded songs. I will look up the performances in iTunes later. I might like some enough to buy them.</p>
<p>Along with ending of American Idol 2010, my other favourite TV show 24 also ended. That should free up a lot of time for me in the summer.</p>

<p>We just moved into a rental apartment leaving Rainbow Village. Its been a memorable and happy ~3 years at Rainbow Village. The 2 bedroom apartment had a good balance of convenience and luxury. I will miss the view from the living room and the good people in the building who helped, cared and supported us while we called it our home. The Lin family has played a major role in our lives so far and will continue to do so. We continue along our journey hoping that the next residence we settle in will be worth leaving the comfort, convenience and luxury of Rainbow Village.</p>

<hr /><h2><a href="/2010/02/05/the-bokeh-machine/">At Last, I Get the Bokeh Machine</a></h2>
<small><p>Feb 05, 2010</p></small>
<p>I finally got my first Digital SLR camera. As expected, it's a Nikon D40 body with the 35/1.8 DX lens. It does exactly what I wanted: Make good photos indoors with available light. But it has also started me on another more philosophical thing.</p>
<p>When I started making photos, my goal was to capture a moment in a frame, as is. No manipulation, no artistic touch (as if I have any). All these years, my goal¬†has been to reproduce reality with photography. So the photographs I upload are exactly as it came from the camera (with cropping applied if needed). The bokeh, color and light I get with the DSLR makes the photograph look good but quite different from reality. This has got me thinking about the artistic aspects of a photography.</p>
<blockquote>I'm not trying to reproduce nature. I encourage people to be creative. I personally use any sort of artificial anything I can to create the look I want. I'm expressing my imagination, not trying to duplicate reality. -- <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/filters.htm">Ken Rockwell</a></blockquote>
<p>So, this year, I will start to apply more than just cropping to &quot;finish&quot; my photographs.</p>
<p>Another thing I will do more is take photo of people rather than only things.</p>
<hr /><h2><a href="/2010/01/29/outsourcing-website-infrastructure/">Outsourcing Website Infrastructure</a></h2>
<small><p>Jan 29, 2010</p></small>
<p>I finally outsourced my website hosting after running it at home for over 2 years. This is intended to be an interim measure before I move it Google App Engine (maybe 2011). Wordpress is an impressive blogging program with a good balance of ease of use and flexibility.</p>
<p>This is part of my list of things that I will let go of in 2010. Not having to run a website from home means no need to have a computer always on and connected. Now I can repurpose the computer for something else (try a *nix desktop again!).</p>
<p>Another thing I let go of recently is the dual monitor setup(having used it for over 1.5 years). Now I have only one monitor. The objective is to remove clutter, simplify which should help me focus better.</p>
