<small><p class="post-date">Jan 10, 2012</p></small>
<p>My friend fell victim to a computer virus(The Bad). After my standard approaches to remove the virus (including MSRT, online solutions) failed, I resorted to factory reset for the Asus laptop. Factory reset was simple and convenient (compared to installing Windows followed by drivers etc.) and completed successfully(The Good) but then I had to spend another hour removing useless preloaded applications(The Ugly).</p>
<p>Shame on Asus for making their customers suffer these 'bloatware'/'crapware' .</p>
<p>If I did not have the below guide, it would have taken me more time (Thanks David)

<small><p class="post-date">Jan 08, 2012</p></small>
Yesterday, I was at the India Visa office to collect my passport. As one would expect, the majority of people in the office at the time were Indians and also as expected, everyone was wearing typical winter clothes: down jackets, sport jackets, coats etc. In short, the clothing was typical western winter wear. But there was one lady that was stood out. She was wearing a sari, Indian jewellery like bangles, rings and even had a nose stud that is common in India. There were about 30 people in the office including staff but she was the only one who was not wearing typical western winter attire. But that is not the interesting part. The interesting part is she was a white lady! So, in an India visa office filled with brown people wearing typical western winter wear, there was this one white lady wearing traditional Indian clothes and jewellery. What an inversion!
