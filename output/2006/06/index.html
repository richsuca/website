<p>Jun 11, 2006</p>
<p>Woke up early today [Sunday] just to catch the final between Roger Federer &amp; Rafael Nadal live. While it did turn out to be a decent game, the result was not exactly what I was cheering for.</p>
<p>I wanted to see a piece of history made today [Federer has won the last 3 majors, this would have completed a sort of 'grand slam' of all four majors in a row, something which has not happened for a long long time] but he had Rafael Nadal in his path and just could'nt get it done losing in 4 sets.</p>
<p>Its been at least a few years now since I last watched a tennis match end-to-end. Most of my tennis watching was during the Pete Sampras-Andre Agassi era. But the matchup between Federer &amp; Nadal was one which got me back into watching.</p>

The world cup starts this Friday and I ordered an addition to my cable TV package today.<br /><br />Here in Toronto, the World Cup will be covered by 3 channels out of which I had 2 already. But, as a die hard Brazil team supporter, I had to order the 3rd one so that I don't miss any of the Ronaldo-Ronaldinho action. I will not be watching the Monday to Saturday matches live as I will be at work :-( but hopefully, no one at work will discuss the results with me and I can enjoy the repeat telecasts [or what is called 'encore' here] as good as live.<br /><br />Watching and following world cup alone [Caroline is not much of a sports fan] will not be the same as back home in India where every one at home and in the city will be jumping up and down and ohh and aahing and cursing together..  Soccer, if its not already, will be the prime source of gossip and debate in Kolkata and I will miss that.<br /><br />Soccer world cup is the most watched TV event in the whole wide world but I am not sure how people in Toronto follow it. Will find out and report back.<br /><br />ole.. ole.ole.ole....ole....
