  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are staying at a Disney Resort hotel and you bought day passes (1 park per day) for all four parks, then the first thing to decide is which park on which day.</p>
<p>Three things to consider:</p>
<p>1) Day specific events<br />
Firework shows don't happen every day. During our visit, the Magic Kingdom <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/magic-kingdom/happily-ever-after-fireworks">fireworks</a> was on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday only. This is the best fireworks show I have seen so you should not miss it.</p>
<p>2) Extra Magic Hours<br />
On select days, parks are open earlier or close later only for Disney hotel guests. Disney calls this extra time "Extra Magic Hours". During our visit, Animal Kingdom had Extra Magic Hours from 8am-9am on Tuesday. We used that early entry to line up for the very popular <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_CA/attractions/animal-kingdom/avatar-flight-of-passage/"><em>Avatar Flight of Passage</em></a> ride*. As we entered Animal Kingdom, I saw a line of visitors (not staying at Disney hotel) that weren't allowed to get in yet so the one hour head start does make a difference.</p>
<p>3) Arriving and Departure days<br />
On the day you arrive or depart, you will not have a full day so either don't visit a park on that day or pick one that you can enjoy in the shorter day without rushing. We arrived Saturday noon and didn't visit any park. After a leisurely lunch, we spent the afternoon shopping at The Loop outlet. On the day of departure, our bus from hotel to airport was at 5.45pm so we picked Epcot for that shorter day since it seemed the most relaxing**.</p>
<p>Planning help
Please refer to the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/calendars/five-day/">guide for park hours</a> to find out Fireworks days and Extra Magic hours.</p>
<p>Three useful guides to keep handy
I had three guides in my pocket all the time and used it often. You can get these at the hotel or parks.</p>
<p>1) Times Guide for all resorts that also shows Extra Magic Hours and times for popular events.<br />
2) Times Guide for the parks. One per park.<br />
3) Guide map for the parks. One per park.</p>
<p>They have a mobile app that is very useful but the Wi-Fi in the parks wasn't reliable so we used the paper guide and maps most of the time. We did use our roaming data connection to check wait times for rides.</p>
<p>After selecting the park to visit for each day, next comes selecting three FastPass for each park.</p>
<p>*Still ended up waiting for over an hour for the ride but it was worth it. Due to height restrictions, my daughter couldn't go so the wife stayed with her while my son and I went in. To our pleasant surprise, we got a FastPass that the wife used to get into the ride later without starting at the beginning of the line again. She waited just 30 mins compared to the normal 2 hrs wait.</p>
<p>**After 3 days of rides and shows, Epcot was indeed more relaxing and we didn't wait more than 10 mins for any show or ride thanks to our FastPasses. I wish we had more time to cover all the countries and the variety of food options. I understand now why some say it is their favourite park.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent episode of CBC's <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever">Now or Never</a> asked listeners to make their own <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever/create-your-own-now-or-never-list-and-start-getting-things-done-1.4266605">Now or Never list</a>. Its a checklist to help get things done. I decided to give it a try*. First question: "One thing I did as a kid that I’d love to do now is ". I filled in "Play". Few days later, I got an email from the show asking me to expand on that answer. Here it is:</p>
<p>As a child, playing occupied most of my time. When I wasn't playing (school, homework, tuition, chores), I was thinking of playing, or reading about it, or watching a game. Growing up in the 80s &amp; 90s in India, football (soccer) and cricket were the two games I played the most both indoors and outdoors. I also played tops, marbles, flew kites, field hockey, chess, and others. Playing gave me pure joy. Scoring a fluke goal in football (school inter-class game), hitting a "full toss" for a "six", winning my first Chess game for school are some memories I still look back fondly. Of the hundreds of kites that I tried to fly on trespassed rooftops, I just got a handful in the air but it was worth the cuts to the fingers and the yelling I got.</p>
<p>Playing indoors is another memory I cherish because of the fun I had playing with my brothers and cousins. I got yelled at a lot for breaking things but I am grateful to my grandmother and parents for allowing us to play. One time, in an indoor cricket game, I was bowling to my brother Robert who hit the ball towards my father's plants behind me by the windows. One of the plants fell and I instinctively ran to it and caught it. Unfortunately for me, it was a cactus! My father was upset but didn't overreact (something I only truly appreciated after I became a father myself). This is one of my kids' favourite bedtime stories.</p>
<p>I also followed sports regularly on TV and magazines. Tennis (Sampras-era) and Formula 1 (Schumacher-Ferrari era) were the two sports I didn't play but followed regularly (cut-outs of Sampras kissing his Wimbledon trophy is probably still sitting in some scrapbook somewhere).</p>
<p>Watching Romario score a goal for Brazil in the Football World Cup, or Sachin Tendulkar hit a Six against Pakistan in Cricket, or a clean Sampras forehand winner, or Mika Häkkinen overtaking someone in F1 gave me thrills that words cannot describe. A couple of years ago, I rode the go-cart for the first time and I imagined myself in an F1 car trying to find the perfect racing line. It was fun.</p>
<p>The playing stopped around the time I got into university but the following didn't. Then came computers, marriage, immigration to Canada, making a life here, and I stopped following as well (except for the occasional "historic" game like Federer vs Nadal in the 2006 French Open final).</p>
<p>Things changed after my son was born. I started playing again with him (and still do to this day). He plays drop-in soccer at YMCA twice a week, started Shinny hockey last year and I enjoy watching all of it. Hockey is the only sport we both follow regularly and we do it with the same nerdy obsession like I had when I was a growing up. My favourite is the Leafs, followed by Penguins. My son knows all the jersey numbers of Penguins players and he will cheer against the Leafs just to irritate me but he likes the M, N, M (Awesome Mathews, Nylander, Marner). I can't wait for the NHL season to start.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Backstory: The wife offered Aiden one Monopoly house as payment for an essay about Minecraft. He wrote it by hand on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zfxvuc13hdzecdd/minecraftessay.jpg?dl=0">paper</a>. Below is the digital version.</em></p>
<p>Aiden 08/18/17<br />
Salary: 1 house (Monopoly)</p>
<p>Minecraft Essay (Job)<br />
The topic of the essay is Minecraft. Minecraft is a 3-D Pixel block game. The producers of the game are Jeb, and Notch. The main objective is to survive, create, and have fun.</p>
<p>Minecraft is a simple and fun pixel game. It takes your creativity and imagination to become a reality! In Minecraft, there are two modes to choose from: Creative or Survival. Creative is where you focus more on building. You have access to all the blocks, in the Creative inventory. Survival, you have to focus on more, well, surviving. You have nothing when you start the world. You have to gather resources, and build a shelter. You can craft, farm, build, battle, go to other dimensions, and get a few pets. There are few <em>mobs</em> (short for mobile), there are passive, neutral, and hostile mobs. Passive mobs never attack you, neutral mobs don't attack you unless you attack them or provoke them. Hostile mobs will attack you on sight.</p>
<p>Well, that's Minecraft. Hope you like my essay and download Minecraft available on these platforms: PC, Mac, XBox 360, XBox One, PS3, PS4, XBox One S, iPad/tablet, Nitendo Switch, Wii, Wii U, Phone, and more. If you have already downloaded Minecraft, then why did you read this?</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>She walked on stage, bowed to us, then sat down in front of the grand piano. She played the first notes but it didn’t sound right. After scanning through the keys, she tried again, and it still didn’t sound right. She looked worried. She tried it again and stopped, shaking her head. Her eyes briefly turned towards the audience looking for someone (her lips read <em>mommy</em>). She looked back at the piano keys one more time to search for the starting key. All this happened quickly but I could imagine the teacher, seated in the front row, patiently alternating between waiting or helping.</p>
<p>When it became clear she needed help, the teacher walked up to the piano, gently placed her fingers on the right key and we were treated to a beautiful performance of <em>Ode to Joy</em>. It was an amazing thing to see. She played confidently, not missing a beat or key, and completed what was likely the first performance of her life. We clapped and cheered for her as she bowed to us and walked back to her seat.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only memorable moment in the Spring music concert for students. My daughter also performed for the first time in her life and it went well. In five months, Adele went from knowing nothing about music or piano to playing <em>Part of your world</em> in front of an audience full of strangers. I hope she continues to learn and enjoy music.</p>]]></description>

  <title>Phones</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>I wish a phone call is <em>still</em> about something other than a donation, credit card, survey, vacation, or duct cleaning. Most of the time it isn't, so I hardly pick up phones now. If I am nearby, I will glance at the caller ID and see if I recognise the name or number. Most of the time I don't, so it goes unanswered and the automated voice messaging system takes over. If I am <em>still</em> nearby, I will listen to the voice message. Most of the time, there is none. If the message is from someone that isn't soliciting, I will call back.</p>
<p>It is sad that marketing calls have turned a simple, elegant solution into a nuisance.</p>
<p>When I was a kid (90s in Kolkata, India), my elderly neighbour had the first phone in the entire building! Her son in Germany sponsored what was then a luxurious gadget. The ring of the phone was distinct and eventful for everyone in the building (we had open doors and windows during the day). Others in the building or nearby also benefited as they got prearranged calls from distant places. It was a magical gadget. Eventually, we got one as well. Having a phone at home eliminated errands I despised. I didn't have to bike to the residential gas cylinder office and stand in line for an hour to book a replacement. A phone call worked.</p>
<p>The Canadian <a href="https://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/insnum-regnum-eng">National Do Not Call List</a> and regulatory <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/duct-cleaning-companies-pay-55-000-for-violating-do-not-call-list-1.3007159">enforcement</a> has helped but it hasn’t eliminated marketing calls completely. I am looking forward to a screening solution like Adblockers, firewalls, etc. for computers. Hopefully, it will bring the magic back, when the voice of a person follows my <em>Hello</em> and we have a delightful conversation.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Wanted Root Beer.</p>
<p>I would have settled for a Diet Coke or anything cold and fizzy.</p>
<p>Skipped McDonalds because of three cars waiting at the Drive-Through.</p>
<p>Skipped the convenience store because I felt lazy to park the car.</p>
<p>At the mall, I went to the juice seller, ordered a Mango juice instead.</p>
<p>The lady taking the order heard Mango Smoothie and that is what she shouted to her colleague behind the counter.</p>
<p>I heard it but did nothing.</p>
<p>I got the Mango Smoothie, forced myself through half of it, and then threw the rest into the garbage.</p>
<p>Wasted perfectly edible Mango, water, and all that went into the Smoothie.</p>
<p>Wasted $5.</p>
<p>I still crave a Root Beer.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>I slept at 3am due to a dinner social event that ended late and also my pre-sleep bad habit of labouring over specification, benchmark, review, and pricing of desktop computer parts and camera equipment. <a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2012/03/04/10-tips-on-how-to-cure-yourself-of-gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome/">G.A.S</a> attack comes and goes but it is especially brutal between the November to January Birthday-Christmas season. I am close to the bottom of that now but that is a story for another day.</p>
<p>So this morning, sleepy and lethargic, I was vacuuming the basement and not enjoying it at all when I found a small toy in a corner. Recognising it as a Shopkin, I gave it to my daughter who was happy to get it back. She said "Oh! that's my <a href="http://shopkin.toys/shopkins/54/1-054:jelly-b:rare">Jelly Bean Joe</a><sup>*</sup>".</p>
<p>And just like that, life is interesting again!</p>
<p><small>
* Online, I found references to Jelly B. but not <em>Jelly Bean Joe</em> so I asked my son. He educated me that it is a character from the TV show Odd Squad.

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Let's not kid ourselves, Canada is in the war business<br />
Why the Canadian government hasn't criticized Saudi Arabia for its brutal attacks in Yemen [?]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil Macdonald, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-canada-macdonald-1.3810952">CBC</a>.</p>
<p>Canada has a conflict of interest because Saudi Arabia is the No. 1 customer for our <a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/new-details-revealed-about-saudi-lav-sale-by-general-dynamics-land-systems-canada">military business</a>. The 14-year $14.8 billion <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/04/canada-would-face-multi-billion-dollar-penalty-if-it-cancelled-armoured-vehicle-sale-to-saudis.html">contract</a> to sell Light Armoured Vehicle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV_III">LAV</a>) is just 0.20% of Canadian <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/160406/t003a-eng.htm">exports</a> annually but Canada's business reputation and 3000 jobs are at stake. There is no win-win here. Faced with a choice between a big business deal and 3000 Canadian jobs versus the safety of innocent civilians in far-away countries, Harper chose Canada and Trudeau did the same. Canadians, not the innocent civilians of Yemen elected them Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Other arms exporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World.27s_largest_arms_exporters">countries</a> are not clean either.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used simple and clear language in his <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-09-20/secretary-generals-address-general-assembly-scroll-down-bilingual">address</a> to the General Assembly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Powerful patrons that keep feeding the war machine also have blood on their hands.  Present in this Hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>I got my daily <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/narcissism.html">A.Word.A.Day</a> (AWAD) email and the word of the day was <em>narcissism</em>. This was the first of many words related to the <em>con man running for the president of the United States</em>. Many things have been said and written about him but a few quotes in the email still surprised me and pushed the bar of narcissistic behaviour lower. I shared the AWAD email with my friend Deepti and her response was interesting. She was more curious about <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anu/">Anu Garg</a> (creator of AWAD) and told me his bio is impressive. That made me go to wordsmith.org to read more about him. One of his creations is the <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html">Internet Anagram Server</a>.</p>
<p>Curious to try it, I typed "Yet another blog" and clicked on <em>Get anagrams</em>. The anagram <em>Altogether Bony</em> got my attention and I liked it. I considered giving my website a name before but didn't like the names I could think of. Google search for <em>Altogether Bony</em> showed results related to <em>bones</em> but the exact phrase was not in use. It was a nonsensical name, had A. B. initials, and made me think of bare essentials. Deepti didn't like it because it made her think of bones too so she went back to the Internet Anagram Server and looked at other anagrams of <em>Yet another blog</em>. She recommended <em>A Lengthy Reboot</em>. Voila! It was geeky, relevant, and interesting.</p>
<p>So that is how this website got its name.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On a September 1st afternoon, I found an article about <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/698452/">Linux kernel GPL enforcement</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. It referenced Torvald's <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-August/003580.html">reply</a> on the thread. I read it and enjoyed the argument made and the style it was made in. It also got me curious about plain text formatting (<code>*bold*</code>, <code>_underscore_</code>,  <code>[footnotes]</code>, <code>&gt; for quoting</code>). I suddenly had a desire to write like that and wondered if there was a blogging service that supported that. My website <em>was</em> on WordPress and it could work using <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> Html tag but plain text wasn't <em>the</em> only way to write.</p>
<p>So I Googled for "plain text blog" and found <a href="http://calepin.co/">http://calepin.co/</a> and it was nice but not exactly what I was looking for. I noticed the words "Powered by Pelican" in the footer. That got me looking up <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and I learnt it was a "static site generator written in Python". Interesting<sup>1</sup>. On the same Google results page, there was a blog post about <a href="https://www.notionsandnotes.org/tech/web-development/pelican-static-blog-setup.html">building a static blog with Pelican</a>. The post describes blogging options and makes an argument for static site generators. It also provides step-by-step instructions to get Pelican working, but the most useful paragraph for me was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hosting resources required for public deployment are very small, 
allowing one to use very cheap hosts such as NearlyFreeSpeech. Outside the domain registration costs, 
the running costs come to less than $1 per month, which is a great saving!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> was the final<sup>3</sup> ingredient needed to make <a href="https://github.com/richsuca/chaipress">Chaipress</a> - my own static site generator. I don't know if it was the geekiness of NearlyFreeSpeech's website, their philosophy, or the pricing but it got me started and I had the first generated website up on September 17th. Writing the generator didn't take long but importing my WordPress posts did<sup>2</sup>. And I forgot about the plain text <em>only</em> thing that started all this.</p>
<p>I called it Chaipress because Chai(tea) is simple, easy-to-make, low cost, and refreshing. The <em>press</em> is a suffix borrowed from the names of other blogging systems (WordPress, Octopress).</p>
<p><small>
Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python is my favourite and Blogging apps are an eternal curiosity of mine. I did try Pelican. </li>

  <title>World Cup of Hockey: NA vs. Russia</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ice.wch2016.com/recap?id=2016060106">match</a> between North America(NA) and Russia in the World Cup of Hockey was fast, exciting, dramatic, and had an edge-of-the-seat heart pounding finish that makes hockey entertaining to watch. There was also the young guns of <em>The West</em> (US &amp; Canada) versus the men of Russia angle. The end result was disappointing for me but Russia deserved to win it.</p>
<p>Some commentary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matt Murray had a bad night and gave up 4 goals in a short span of time. That was too much to recover from even with the talent and youth that NA had. Gibson was solid after taking over from Murray and kept NA in the game till the end. It will be interesting to see if Murray starts in the next game and how will this affect his role in Penguins' lineup next month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bobrovsky, on the other hand, allowed 3 goals on 46 shots from NA. He was the MVP of the game. Russia, with their NHL <em>snipers</em> could only make 25 shots on goal. The contrast between shots and goals reminded me of <a href="https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/sjs-vs-pit/2016/06/09/2015030415/recap/box-score#game=2015030415,game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=boxscore">Game 5</a> of the Stanley Cup finals between Penguins and Sharks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NA team was too fancy many times resulting in missed chances or turnovers. It was nice to watch but not helpful to their cause. Time and experience in NHL will impart the wisdom to decide when to try low percentage moves and when to just keep it simple and pass or shoot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the shock of going from 1-0 to 4-1, the young guns of NA regained composure with the late 2nd-period goal. That set up an exciting 3rd-period chase. It was comforting that NA didn't panic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from a one-timer that hit the post, Ovechkin was quiet. Same for Malkin. Datsyuk was busy and I saw some smooth moves but it was the other players that made the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was my first time watching the new NHL players like Auston Matthews, Morgan Reilly, Connor McDavid, and Nathan MacKinnon. I am excited for the start of the NHL season with two of them playing for Toronto Maple Leafs especially Auston Matthews (first draft pick).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could easily have gone to overtime. Now I regret deleting the recorded game. I could watch the 3rd period many times and still not get bored like Game 6 of the 2015-16 Penguins vs Sharks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was an odd experience watching the recorded game and forwarding to skip the ads and commentaries. While I could watch the match in just over an hour instead of the two to three hours a live broadcast takes, it felt a bit rushed and highlight like. Maybe I missed the commentaries. Maybe the act of pressing <em>Forward</em> and <em>Play</em> on the remote control frequently disrupted the concentration needed to enjoy and watch the game. Maybe both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice I didn't use the word <em>grit</em> that Team USA has been using to describe their style of physically aggressive play. There was some pushing around, <a href="https://youtu.be/3035JsLNMX0"><em>face washing</em></a>, and body checks but all forgettable. It was few and far in between and didn't matter. That is how hockey should be played.</p>
</li>
</ul>
