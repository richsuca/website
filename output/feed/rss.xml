  <description><![CDATA[<p>The wife and I watched HBO’s TV series Chernobyl. At the end of the TV series, it showed real footage of the scientists, politicians, and the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (whatever was left of it). It also tells the story of what happened after. Or does it?</p>
<p>The epilogue of the TV series says the character of Ulana Khomyuk is fictional. That surprised me because the character played a major role as a scientist in containing the damage from the open reactor core, as a fact-finder that pieced together the cause of the disaster, and as a moral compass that convinced Legasov to tell the truth. Her character is meant to represent dozens of scientists that helped. As I was watching the TV series, I did wonder why they had only two scientists helping with the recovery. There must have been so many factors, theories, and simulations to work through. Where did all the Soviet scientists go?</p>
<p>The HBO TV series isn’t a documentary, it is a historical drama based on real events. Putting all that into five episodes requires creative liberties. But they did name it <em>Chernobyl</em> after the real <em>Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</em> where the incident happened. The trailer of the TV series says it is "BASED ON THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY". Actual dates and names of real people are used. As I watched the five-part episodes, I came to think of it as a documentary, believing everything to be realistic. It was very well made, kept me fully engaged throughout, made me think, feel, admire, and empathise. It certainly deserves all the critical acclaim and awards. I would likely watch it again.</p>
<p>Curious about the details of the real disaster, and what happened after, I went to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)">Wikipedia articles</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl</a> was educational but it also challenged the authenticity of many events and characters in the TV series.</p>
<p>Here are some things that aren’t accurate or are completely fictional.</p>
<h2>Death toll</h2>
<p>In the epilogue, it says "Most estimates range from 4,000 to 93,000 deaths". That is a very large range, and the upper limit is especially suspect. According to the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster">article</a>, the number of deaths is contested due to lack of consensus among various government and international groups that have attempted to calculate it. I did see the figures of 4,000 (immediate and long-term deaths) but the upper-end estimates reach 16,000. Nowhere did I read anything close to 93,000!</p>
<p>16,000 to 93,000 is a serious inflation, and I will try to erase that number from my memory.</p>
<h2>The Bridge of Death</h2>
<p>A powerful, sad, and memorable image from the TV series are of the residents of Pripyat standing on a bridge to see the burning Chernobyl power plant. Per the epilogue, none of them survived. This is not true according to Adam Higginbotham who spent a decade researching Chernobyl and wrote a book about it. He interviewed someone who was on that bridge and is <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/05/the-human-drama-of-chernobyl/">still alive</a>. It is possible <em>everyone</em> on that bridge watching the burning power plant didn't die.</p>
<p>This one will be hard to forget.</p>
<h2>Threat of force</h2>
<p>In episode 1, Anatoly Sitnikov is forced by an armed guard to go to the roof and confirm if Reactor Core 4 exploded or not. He didn't want to go because the radiation measurements maxed out, and he saw what he thought were graphite pieces from the Reactor Core on the ground outside the building.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/06/04/the-pain-doesn-t-fade">one</a> account, this isn't true. He went to inspect it willingly because he was familiar with the reactor, and like others, he wanted to help contain the damage. By other accounts, in 1980s USSR, bureaucrats couldn't just order armed guards to force people into doing things against their will.</p>
<h2>Watch but take an antidote</h2>
<p>If I didn’t read Wikipedia articles and the TV series was the only source of information about Chernobyl, then, over time, that would have settled in as fact, and history. It would likely have influenced my opinion about the Soviet Union, about the role of bureaucrats, scientists etc.</p>
<p>I would rewatch the TV series because I tend to miss many things the first time. But I will watch it the way I read opinion pieces in newspapers. Take it as one person's opinion made with news events arranged to influence the reader in a particular way.</p>
<p>My kids watch a lot of YouTube and they tend to believe what the videos show. It is a constant challenge for me to remind them that everything they watch isn’t real, or true. I keep repeating that YouTube is for entertainment only. But I feel like I am on the losing side of this.</p>
<p>Of course, I keep thinking about limiting or completely blocking YouTube. Often, I force them to stop and watch Netflix or Crave instead. Yes, we’ve reached the point where binging on Netflix is the lesser of two evils. They watch it the same way they read storybooks and comics. But they take YouTube videos seriously.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A friend emailed me <a href="http://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html">Einstein's riddle</a>. He said it took him 25 mins to solve. That gave me a bit of motivation to give it a try. I was at my son's swimming lesson when I read the email and quickly realised that I wasn't going to beat his time. But, as I started solving it with Google Sheets on the iPhone, the idea of using database tables and Sql to generate cartesian product, followed by a process of filtering out untrue data got me intrigued.</p>
<p>It took me well over an hour but it worked and it was fun. <em>Stop</em> here and go to the riddle page linked above if you want to give it try.</p>
<p>I used a Sqlite database and below Sql to solve it.</p>

4   german      white   fish    water   prince
5   german      white   fish    water   prince
</pre>

<p>With my son's help, I created tables with pen &amp; paper, filled one column with one of the possibilities, then filled the blanks using hints. When one of the hints conflicted with what we had filled in, we stopped, and repeated the process with the next one. It got faster as we went through them and the 12th row in the list turned out to be the one.</p>
<p>The hand written table looked like:</p>
<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>

<p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>

    <th>5</th>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/earth">Minecraft Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/10th-anniversary">10 years of Minecraft</a>, I wanted to go down memory lane and revisit all the Minecraft items that I bought, downloaded and installed over the years for my son Aiden<sup>*</sup>.</p>
<p>First came the Minecraft "Pocket Edition" iPad app (2014), then he got an Xbox 360 gaming console (2015) so I had to buy a Minecraft "Xbox 360" game DVD. </p>
<p>That is two different Minecraft items.</p>
<p>At some point in 2017, Aiden wanted to play Minecraft on the Windows PC because it had a keyboard and many features that the Xbox 360 one didn't. When I saw Minecraft "Windows 10" edition was on sale for $15, I didn't waste any time getting it.</p>
<p>The four-year-old iPad 3 was too slow, so we got an iPad Pro. Fortunately, I didn't have to buy yet another Minecraft as the previous iPad app could be restored at no cost.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Aiden could play Minecraft on a touchscreen iPad, with a gaming controller on the Xbox, and keyboard on the Windows PC.</p>
<p>In January of 2018, I got tired of my kids fighting over the new iPad, so we bought a Kindle tablet from Amazon. Yes! I bought Minecraft for the Kindle too.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I made the dumbest move yet when I let Aiden play Fortnite on my Windows PC. The PC didn't have enough horsepower to run modern games smoothly. Fortnite worked but under lower graphics settings which bothered me more than him. Xbox 360 was the best gaming device we had but it was three years old so new games like Fortnite wasn't made to work on it. Doubling down on my dumbest move, I got the latest generation Xbox One S gaming console to replace Xbox 360, so he could play Fortnite in all its glory. </p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft <a href="https://www.Xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-one/backward-compatibility">didn't bother</a> to make the Minecraft "Xbox 360" game work on the Xbox One. For six months, Fortnite possessed my son completely and he didn't play Minecraft much. When he did play, it was on the Windows PC. It didn't bother him that he couldn't play Minecraft on the Xbox One. Not yet.</p>
<p>So, Minecraft was available on the Windows PC, iPad Pro, and Kindle, but not on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>The Fortnite fever eventually subsided and he started grumbling about not being able to play Minecraft on the Xbox One. Since giving my son <em>every</em> possible Minecraft option on every floor of the house, on all screens was very important to me, I shelled out $30 for Minecraft for Xbox One edition in early 2019.</p>
<p>With that, he could play Minecraft on the iPad, Kindle, Windows PC, and Xbox One (Xbox 360 was packed away but on standby).</p>
<p>Aiden typically plays Minecraft online with his friends and sometimes with his sister Adele. All the above Minecrafts can connect to each other and join the same "world". It seemed like we had it all covered. He was able to play with everyone: school mates, other friends, soccer &amp; hockey buddies, and online "friends".</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, one of his school mates got a Minecraft "Java" edition. The "Java" edition only connects to other "Java" editions. You can install it on Windows 10, but it is different from the "Windows 10" edition that we have! The "Java" edition players connect to a different world than the Xbox/iPad/Kindle/Windows 10 one. My son can't play with him!</p>
<p>The rest of the story is unwritten.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup><small><em>my daughter Adele plays too but occasionally</em>.</small></p>]]></description>

  <title>Aquaman Without Coffee</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Last night at the movies, after sitting down in theatre 9 to watch Aquaman with the wife, we felt like having coffee. So I went back down to get one. Not being experienced with movie going at the theatres, I wasn't sure if I could exit and re-enter so I asked the guy scanning tickets at the entrance and he said yes, but, he also said, "No, thank you!", "I don't need any coffee". He said it without any expression but I had a laugh and he smiled back :)</p>
<p>I probably will not remember <em>Aquaman</em> but that guy, he was funny. When I came back with the coffee, he said "I told you, I don't need coffee. Thank you"</p>]]></description>

  <title>4K Monitor (Enable DisplayPort 1.2, Disable DDC/CI)</title>
  <link>https://richardhsu.net/2018/11/14/4K/</link>

  <pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>Getting a 4K monitor (Dell UP2414Q) working with Windows 10 took a lot more than I expected. My computer motherboard supports 4K resolution @ 30 Hz via HDMI but most people online say 4K @ 30 Hz will not be smooth. Having used monitors at 60 Hz refresh rate for as long as I can remember, I didn't want to take a chance and got the graphics card (AMD RX 460) that supports 4K @ 60 Hz via DisplayPort.</p>
<p>When I powered up the 4K monitor, I saw the sharp, colour accurate, bright, and "retina" 4K display that I was expecting but it was running at 30 Hz. It was usable, and I didn't notice any lag. Still, I wanted to get the refresh rate to 60 Hz for <em>best</em> results. There was just no way to pick 4K @ 60 Hz.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to find the answer online. The monitor's <em>DisplayPort 1.2</em> was disabled (default setting). Enabling it via the monitor menu refreshed the available resolutions and refresh rates and I was able to pick 3840 x 2160 (4K) @ 60 Hz. It was noticeably smoother than 30 Hz, so the internet people were right.</p>
<p>Then I ran into another problem: when the monitor powered back on after sleep, the screen would split into two with the left half at a lower resolution and stretched out (the right half was fine). It was not usable at all. This problem took a while to figure out including time wasted trying Dell's customer support.</p>
<p>Again, changing a monitor setting solved it. Only this time, I disabled the setting called <em><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/630555/turning-displayport-monitor-off-disables-monitor-completely">DDC/CI</a></em>.</p>
<p>I still have one unsolved problem, but it is easy to work around. When Windows turns off the monitor to enter sleep mode, it stops sending the signal via the DisplayPort. I can't <em>wake</em> the monitor up using keyboard or mouse. When I power on the monitor, it still doesn't get any display signal from the computer. This thing drove me crazy for about an hour (monitor connected via HDMI doesn't have this problem). I finally gave up trying to make this work. Instead, I don't let Windows power off the monitor. I do it myself by pressing the power button.</p>
<p>What I learnt is a DisplayPort connection between monitor and computer isn't a simple one-way connection like it is with VGA or DVI. DisplayPort is a two-way connection meaning the monitor sends back data about its capabilities to the computer every time it powers up and the computer then figures out what signal to send (much like a USB printer or mouse). When the computer puts the monitor to sleep and wakes it back up, something goes wrong in that connection negotiation and I end up with either a half screen unusable display or completely off monitor.</p>
<p>Having to physically press the power button on the monitor to turn it off and on is something new for me but I don't mind it.</p>
<p>Update: I still get the no-signal or split screen randomly, To fix it, I change Input Source to HDMI, wait, then switch it back to DisplayPort and it works</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>My son has two dictionaries: Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary, and The Kid Dictionary. The Kid Dictionary has made up words to describe the indescribable and it is hilarious!</p>
<p>I don't remember him ever using the Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary and I doubt it is still around.</p>
<p>The other night, while reading the story of The Brave Little Tailor (again) to my daughter at bedtime, I was sleepy and skipped a few paragraphs on the last page. My son, who was also in bed but listening, jumped up and told me to pause.</p>
<p>He went to his bookshelf, pulled out The Kid Dictionary, flipped over to page 40, then read out loud: CHAPTURN (verb). "To sneakily skip pages when reading a long children's book to your kid."</p>
<p>Then, turning to page 41, he read: CHAPTURKEY (noun). "A parent who gets caught skipping pages when reading a long children's book to his or her kid".</p>]]></description>

  <title>Fly Hacking and Dragons </title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Fly hacking</em> is a Minecraft term used to describe cheating by a player in a multi-player online game. I learnt this from my son who goes online into Minecraft worlds and plays games with others. To keep it fun, competitive, and fair, players aren't allowed to fly in the games. Flying gives a player unfair advantages. They are supposed to battle on the ground. But there are players who hack into the Minecraft system and fly. When this happens, someone reports them to the server admin and the cheating player gets kicked out of the game.</p>
<p>In Game of Thrones, Daenerys Targaryen has three fire-breathing dragons that give her the same advantage in battles. When she and her soldiers are surrounded by opponents and there is no way out, in flies her Dragon breathing fire, burning people, scaring the pee out of shocked men. She climbs on it and flies out of, what a few moments ago, was a certain death. The Sons of the Harpy had no option to complain about the unfair advantage of a Dragon.</p>
<p>Air strikes in war, giant-sized Eagles in Lord of the Rings, there are many other examples in fiction and reality where one side has an unfair advantage over another. Unlike Minecraft, there is no way to level the playing field.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a time to get together with friends and family, exchange presents, take time off from work, and refresh before the new year.</p>
<p>It is also a time to look back at the year that past, consider how it was spent, memories made, remember those that have pass.</p>
<p>My family brings me joy, meaning, and purpose to my life. But I also miss the family that I am part of but are oceans away: my parents, brothers, and the extended family in India. </p>
<p>This is an immigrant's pain. An immigrant's sacrifice. An immigrant's bargain.</p>
<p>It is the asterisk that has been there for the past 12 years, in all the headlines of my life, reminding me of the family that I left as I embarked on new life in Canada to make my own.</p>
<p>I miss them, wish them well, and pray for them.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are staying at a Disney Resort hotel and you bought day passes (1 park per day) for all four parks, then the first thing to decide is which park on which day.</p>
<p>Three things to consider:</p>
<p>1) Day specific events<br />
Firework shows don't happen every day. During our visit, the Magic Kingdom <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/magic-kingdom/happily-ever-after-fireworks">fireworks</a> was on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday only. This is the best fireworks show I have seen so you should not miss it.</p>
<p>2) Extra Magic Hours<br />
On select days, parks are open earlier or close later only for Disney hotel guests. Disney calls this extra time "Extra Magic Hours". During our visit, Animal Kingdom had Extra Magic Hours from 8am-9am on Tuesday. We used that early entry to line up for the very popular <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_CA/attractions/animal-kingdom/avatar-flight-of-passage/"><em>Avatar Flight of Passage</em></a> ride*. As we entered Animal Kingdom, I saw a line of visitors (not staying at Disney hotel) that weren't allowed to get in yet so the one hour head start does make a difference.</p>
<p>3) Arriving and Departure days<br />
On the day you arrive or depart, you will not have a full day so either don't visit a park or pick one that you can enjoy in the shorter day without rushing. We arrived Saturday noon and didn't visit any park. After a leisurely lunch, we spent the afternoon shopping at The Loop outlet. On the day of departure, our bus from hotel to airport was at 5.45pm so we picked Epcot for that shorter day since it seemed the most relaxing**.</p>
<p>Planning help<br />
Please refer to the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/calendars/five-day/">guide for park hours</a> to find out Fireworks days and Extra Magic hours.</p>
<p>I had three guides in my pocket all the time and used it often. You can get these at the hotel or parks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Times Guide for all parks. This is a weekly guide for park hours, Extra Magic Hours and times for popular events.  </li>
<li>Times Guide for the parks. One per park. This is a two page park specific list of times for popular attractions and events. </li>
<li>Guide map for the parks. One per park. Large well made map of the park, attractions, restaurants, washrooms etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>They have a mobile app that is very useful but the Wi-Fi in the parks wasn't reliable so we used the paper guide and maps most of the time. We did use our roaming data connection to check wait times for rides.</p>
<p>Next<br />
After selecting the park to visit for each day, next comes selecting three FastPass for each park.</p>
<p><small>
*<em>Still ended up waiting for over an hour for the ride but it was worth it. Due to height restrictions, my daughter couldn't go so the wife stayed with her while my son and I went in. To our pleasant surprise, we got a FastPass that the wife used to get into the ride later without starting at the beginning of the line again. She waited just 30 mins compared to the normal 2 hrs wait.</em></p>
<p>**<em>After 3 days of rides and shows, Epcot was indeed more relaxing and we didn't wait more than 10 mins for any show or ride thanks to our FastPasses. I wish we had more time to cover all the countries and the variety of food options. I understand now why some say it is their favourite park.</em>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent episode of CBC's <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever">Now or Never</a> asked listeners to make their own <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever/create-your-own-now-or-never-list-and-start-getting-things-done-1.4266605">Now or Never list</a>. Its a checklist to help get things done. I decided to give it a try*. First question: "One thing I did as a kid that I’d love to do now is ". I filled in "Play". Few days later, I got an email from the show asking me to expand on that answer. Here it is:</p>
<p>As a child, playing occupied most of my time. When I wasn't playing (school, homework, tuition, chores), I was thinking of playing, or reading about it, or watching a game. Growing up in the 80s &amp; 90s in India, football (soccer) and cricket were the two games I played the most both indoors and outdoors. I also played tops, marbles, flew kites, field hockey, chess, and others. Playing gave me pure joy. Scoring a fluke goal in football (school inter-class game), hitting a "full toss" for a "six", winning my first Chess game for school are some memories I still look back fondly. Of the hundreds of kites that I tried to fly on trespassed rooftops, I just got a handful in the air but it was worth the cuts to the fingers and the yelling I got.</p>
<p>Playing indoors is another memory I cherish because of the fun I had playing with my brothers and cousins. I got yelled at a lot for breaking things but I am grateful to my grandmother and parents for allowing us to play. One time, in an indoor cricket game, I was bowling to my brother Robert who hit the ball towards my father's plants behind me by the windows. One of the plants fell and I instinctively ran to it and caught it. Unfortunately for me, it was a cactus! My father was upset but didn't overreact (something I only truly appreciated after I became a father myself). This is one of my kids' favourite bedtime stories.</p>
<p>I also followed sports regularly on TV and magazines. Tennis (Sampras-era) and Formula 1 (Schumacher-Ferrari era) were the two sports I didn't play but followed regularly (cut-outs of Sampras kissing his Wimbledon trophy is probably still sitting in some scrapbook somewhere).</p>
<p>Watching Romario score a goal for Brazil in the Football World Cup, or Sachin Tendulkar hit a Six against Pakistan in Cricket, or a clean Sampras forehand winner, or Mika Häkkinen overtaking someone in F1 gave me thrills that words cannot describe. A couple of years ago, I rode the go-cart for the first time and I imagined myself in an F1 car trying to find the perfect racing line. It was fun.</p>
<p>The playing stopped around the time I got into university but the following didn't. Then came computers, marriage, immigration to Canada, making a life here, and I stopped following as well (except for the occasional "historic" game like Federer vs Nadal in the 2006 French Open final).</p>
<p>Things changed after my son was born. I started playing again with him (and still do to this day). He plays drop-in soccer at YMCA twice a week, started Shinny hockey last year and I enjoy watching all of it. Hockey is the only sport we both follow regularly and we do it with the same nerdy obsession like I had when I was a growing up. My favourite is the Leafs, followed by Penguins. My son knows all the jersey numbers of Penguins players and he will cheer against the Leafs just to irritate me but he likes the M, N, M (Awesome Mathews, Nylander, Marner). I can't wait for the NHL season to start.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Backstory: The wife offered Aiden one Monopoly house as payment for an essay about Minecraft. He wrote it by hand on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zfxvuc13hdzecdd/minecraftessay.jpg?dl=0">paper</a>. Below is the digital version.</em></p>
<p>Aiden 08/18/17<br />
Salary: 1 house (Monopoly)</p>
<p>Minecraft Essay (Job)<br />
The topic of the essay is Minecraft. Minecraft is a 3-D Pixel block game. The producers of the game are Jeb, and Notch. The main objective is to survive, create, and have fun.</p>
<p>Minecraft is a simple and fun pixel game. It takes your creativity and imagination to become a reality! In Minecraft, there are two modes to choose from: Creative or Survival. Creative is where you focus more on building. You have access to all the blocks, in the Creative inventory. Survival, you have to focus on more, well, surviving. You have nothing when you start the world. You have to gather resources, and build a shelter. You can craft, farm, build, battle, go to other dimensions, and get a few pets. There are few <em>mobs</em> (short for mobile), there are passive, neutral, and hostile mobs. Passive mobs never attack you, neutral mobs don't attack you unless you attack them or provoke them. Hostile mobs will attack you on sight.</p>
<p>Well, that's Minecraft. Hope you like my essay and download Minecraft available on these platforms: PC, Mac, XBox 360, XBox One, PS3, PS4, XBox One S, iPad/tablet, Nitendo Switch, Wii, Wii U, Phone, and more. If you have already downloaded Minecraft, then why did you read this?</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>She walked on stage, bowed to us, then sat down in front of the grand piano. She played the first notes but it didn’t sound right. After scanning through the keys, she tried again, and it still didn’t sound right. She looked worried. She tried it again and stopped, shaking her head. Her eyes briefly turned towards the audience looking for someone (her lips read <em>mommy</em>). She looked back at the piano keys one more time to search for the starting key. All this happened quickly but I could imagine the teacher, seated in the front row, patiently alternating between waiting or helping.</p>
<p>When it became clear she needed help, the teacher walked up to the piano, gently placed her fingers on the right key and we were treated to a beautiful performance of <em>Ode to Joy</em>. It was an amazing thing to see. She played confidently, not missing a beat or key, and completed what was likely the first performance of her life. We clapped and cheered for her as she bowed to us and walked back to her seat.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only memorable moment in the Spring music concert for students. My daughter also performed for the first time in her life and it went well. In five months, Adele went from knowing nothing about music or piano to playing <em>Part of your world</em> in front of an audience full of strangers. I hope she continues to learn and enjoy music.</p>]]></description>

  <title>Phones</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>I wish a phone call is <em>still</em> about something other than a donation, credit card, survey, vacation, or duct cleaning. Most of the time it isn't, so I hardly pick up phones now. If I am nearby, I will glance at the caller ID and see if I recognise the name or number. Most of the time I don't, so it goes unanswered and the automated voice messaging system takes over. If I am <em>still</em> nearby, I will listen to the voice message. Most of the time, there is none. If the message is from someone that isn't soliciting, I will call back.</p>
<p>It is sad that marketing calls have turned a simple, elegant solution into a nuisance.</p>
<p>When I was a kid (90s in Kolkata, India), my elderly neighbour had the first phone in the entire building! Her son in Germany sponsored what was then a luxurious gadget. The ring of the phone was distinct and eventful for everyone in the building (we had open doors and windows during the day). Others in the building or nearby also benefited as they got prearranged calls from distant places. It was a magical gadget. Eventually, we got one as well. Having a phone at home eliminated errands I despised. I didn't have to bike to the residential gas cylinder office and stand in line for an hour to book a replacement. A phone call worked.</p>
<p>The Canadian <a href="https://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/insnum-regnum-eng">National Do Not Call List</a> and regulatory <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/duct-cleaning-companies-pay-55-000-for-violating-do-not-call-list-1.3007159">enforcement</a> has helped but it hasn’t eliminated marketing calls completely. I am looking forward to a screening solution like Adblockers, firewalls, etc. for computers. Hopefully, it will bring the magic back, when the voice of a person follows my <em>Hello</em> and we have a delightful conversation.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Wanted Root Beer.</p>
<p>I would have settled for a Diet Coke or anything cold and fizzy.</p>
<p>Skipped McDonalds because of three cars waiting at the Drive-Through.</p>
<p>Skipped the convenience store because I felt lazy to park the car.</p>
<p>At the mall, I went to the juice seller, ordered a Mango juice instead.</p>
<p>The lady taking the order heard Mango Smoothie and that is what she shouted to her colleague behind the counter.</p>
<p>I heard it but did nothing.</p>
<p>I got the Mango Smoothie, forced myself through half of it, and then threw the rest into the garbage.</p>
<p>Wasted perfectly edible Mango, water, and all that went into the Smoothie.</p>
<p>Wasted $5.</p>
<p>I still crave a Root Beer.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>I slept at 3am due to a dinner social event that ended late and also my pre-sleep bad habit of labouring over specification, benchmark, review, and pricing of desktop computer parts and camera equipment. <a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2012/03/04/10-tips-on-how-to-cure-yourself-of-gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome/">G.A.S</a> attack comes and goes but it is especially brutal between the November to January Birthday-Christmas season. I am close to the bottom of that now but that is a story for another day.</p>
<p>So this morning, sleepy and lethargic, I was vacuuming the basement and not enjoying it at all when I found a small toy in a corner. Recognising it as a Shopkin, I gave it to my daughter who was happy to get it back. She said "Oh! that's my <a href="http://shopkin.toys/shopkins/54/1-054:jelly-b:rare">Jelly Bean Joe</a><sup>*</sup>".</p>
<p>And just like that, life is interesting again!</p>
<p><small>
* Online, I found references to Jelly B. but not <em>Jelly Bean Joe</em> so I asked my son. He educated me that it is a character from the TV show Odd Squad.
