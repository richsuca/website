<p>I got my daily <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/narcissism.html">A.Word.A.Day</a> (AWAD) email and the word of the day was <em>narcissism</em>. This was the first of many words related to the <em>con man running for the president of the United States</em>. Many things have been said and written about him but a few quotes in the email still surprised me and pushed the bar of narcissistic behaviour lower. I shared the AWAD email with my friend Deepti and her response was interesting. She was more curious about <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anu/">Anu Garg</a> (creator of AWAD) and told me his bio is impressive. That made me go to wordsmith.org to read more about him. One of his creations is the <a href="http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html">Internet Anagram Server</a>.</p>
<p>Curious to try it, I typed "Yet another blog" and clicked on <em>Get anagrams</em>. The anagram <em>Altogether Bony</em> got my attention and I liked it. I considered giving my website a name before but didn't like the names I could think of. Google search for <em>Altogether Bony</em> showed results related to <em>bones</em> but the exact phrase was not in use. It was a nonsensical name, had A. B. initials, and made me think of bare essentials. Deepti didn't like it because it made her think of bones too so she went back to the Internet Anagram Server and looked at other anagrams of <em>Yet another blog</em>. She recommended <em>A Lengthy Reboot</em>. Voila! It was geeky, relevant, and interesting.</p>
<p>So that is how this website got its name.</p>
