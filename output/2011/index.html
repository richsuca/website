<p>Jun 01, 2011</p>
<p>Today, on the 3rd day of trying, Aiden was able to cycle himself on two wheels. On the 2nd day, he was able to balance a little which was encouraging but was not able to pedal and ride by himself. He was able to ride by himself about 30 feet towards the end of today's attempt. Caroline and I enjoyed watching him balance and pedal by himself first a little bit and then a little more and more. We are both proud of him for achieving this small but significant milestone in his life. I still remember the first day he wanted to try without the side training wheels and struggled a lot eventually giving up. When he finished, he told me to put the training wheels back on and did not seem happy when I said it cannot be put back on and that he cannot give up and have to try and try again. On the 2nd day (after a gap of few days) he was willing to try again without the training wheels andÂ  I remember him telling me many times that he cannot give up. Although he did struggle again, he was able to go very short distances by himself and balance a little. While I could see him improving, it came as a pleasant surprise to me today when he finally got it.</p>
<p>Look forward to cycling with him soon around the neighbourhood.</p>

<hr /><h3><a href="/2011/04/30/ubuntu-11-04">Ubuntu 11.04</a></h3>
<p>Apr 30, 2011</p>
<p>As with previous Ubuntu releases, I downloaded 11.04 releases yesterday to try it out. I followed instruction and created a USB boot disk with 700MB of 'disk' space for session persistence.</p>
<p>So far, I am very impressed. With every release, Ubuntu is getting closer and closer to being an alternative to Microsoft Windows as a consumer desktop OS. I believe it is already as good as Microsoft Windows for business.</p>
<p>1) Skype<br />
I remember having to do a lot of tweaking to get Skype voice call to work in previous Ubuntu releases. The last time I tried Ubuntu, Skype did not have video calling or screen sharing. So I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to install Skype and have video and voice working flawlessly without any tweak! I did not get a chance to try screen sharing yet but I don't expect any problem with it.</p>
<p>2) UI<br />
I like the UI of the Ubuntu 11.04. Overall, it feels minimalist compared to Microsoft Windows. No thick border around all application windows. Love it! The default scroll bars look good as well.</p>
<p>3) Application install<br />
The new Ubuntu Software Center is very user friendly and the overall application install experience is good.</p>
<p>This is exciting. I will use it as an OS on the laptop and see how long I can go without moving back into Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>Mar 22, 2011</p>
Have not been following American Idol 2011 as closely as I did for previous years. Could be a function of life style changes. I did watch the Top 12 performances on the website and my favourite this year is Casey Abrams.
