<small><p class="post-date">Mar 15, 2020</p></small>
<p>Digital things of value to me are in many places (Emails, Google Docs, PC documents, iPhone). At work, we use Wiki, SharePoint, Emails, documents in network drives, tickets, and recently OneNote as an information store. </p>
<p>Finding things is a challenge.</p>
<p>There are three ways I find things (in order of preference):
1. Go to a specific location
2. Full-text search
3. Ask someone</p>
<p>Often, I will use more than one of the above to get to the information I am looking for. For example, I'll go to a specific Google Drive folder where I keep my scanned paper receipts, then do a full-text search <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with the item or store name to find it. Or, at work, I will ask my colleague where to look for something, and I will learn it is in a certain folder in SharePoint, once I navigate to the folder, it is easy to browse through the documents and find it. Option 3 isn’t available at home.</p>
<p>Going to a specific location (my first tendency) requires hierarchical storage, like books in a library (room, aisle, shelf). Find things is a process of elimination.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone &gt; Notes app &gt; Folders (browse) &gt; Note (browse) </li>
<li>PC &gt; Documents &gt; Pictures &gt; 2019 &gt; (browse) &gt; (scroll through large thumbnails)</li>
</ul>
<p>To find things faster, the obvious solution is to have fewer options at every step of the hierarchy and that means more consolidation. At home, I plan to reorganize and move things into just three places: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Documents folder in the PC</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be ideal if it was just 1,2 and I didn’t need 3 but I don’t feel comfortable putting <em>everything</em> into Google (or equivalent), yet. Likewise, at work, we are also moving all digital things into OneNote. Looking forward to that.</p>
<p>One major problem with hierarchical storage: when the location of things isn’t obvious, where does it go? (do you organize photos by year/month/date folder hierarchy or by subject: kids, places, food). It will be harder to find no matter how you choose. Either it will be tedious, or you will go down the wrong path and don’t find it at all, because where you decided to search wasn’t the same place you decided to put it.</p>
<p>Full-text search is very powerful, but it tends to be slow and returns irrelevant results. You also can’t search for non-text things<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So hierarchical navigation is my favourite, but it has its disadvantages, whereas full-text search has a wider reach, but it has problems too.</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>What is missing in my methods is labels or tags. </p>
<p>The only place where I have them is <a href="https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand">Pinboard</a>. As of last week, I had over a thousand website links in Pinboard and 300+ tags for them, but whenever I went looking for links, I just browsed the list of links page-by-page or did a full-text search. Filtering by tags, despite being a prominent feature and easy to use, was the last resort.</p>
<p>The main advantage of tags over hierarchical storage is an object can have many tags (one-to-many). A photo can only exist in one folder (hierarchy) but it can have many tags (location, rating, names). I don’t like complexity, and tags are complex and arbitrary. That’s why I had so many useless tags (interview, park, review, video) in Pinboard. Tags weren’t important to me, so I didn’t name them well, because I had useless tags, I didn’t use them to find things.</p>
<p>I need to put more care into the naming of tags and refine them periodically. But I didn’t bother till recently when I read an article about the <a href="https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand">Zettlekasten</a> method of keeping notes. Tags play a key role in that method. </p>
<p><a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/">Sasha Fast</a> recommends naming tags by objects, not topic. Topic tags have a weaker connection, results in wider search, and don’t age as well as object-based tags.</p>
<p>e.g. of topic tags<br>
idea, funny, quote</p>
<p>Tags named after <em>objects</em> referenced in the digital thing (note, photo) will result in better search relevance and are durable (years later, it will still mean the same), but they tend to have narrow use (tags are used only once), and you end up with a large number of tags.</p>
<p>e.g. of object tags<br>
kids, caroline, NHL</p>
<p>So, a good tag must strike a balance between a topic and <em>object</em> to find the right scope of relevance. </p>
<p>This brings me to the second realization about useful tagging systems, all the tags should fit into one screen, be easy to browse through, and shouldn’t need a filter or search to find. If it is made into a tag cloud, the tags would still be readable, not requiring any squinting. I have decided on the arbitrary upper limit of 50 tags. A periodic review of tags will keep it relevant and keep the number at or below 50.</p>
<p>The third thing about tags is to avoid applying too many tags to an object. I am still early in my tagging process, but I feel this will keep tag count under control and simplify decision making.</p>
<p>I used to think of tags as keywords to add that I can full-text search for, and that made me add many tags to an item. Now I think of tags as a shortlist of predefined labels that I will use to filter things. Filter , not search.</p>
<p>Guided by what I learnt; I have reduced my Pinboard tags from 300+ to under 80 with the help of a homemade <a href="https://github.com/richsuca/Retag/releases">desktop app</a>. I intend to <em><a href="https://konmari.com/">konmari</a></em> it down to less than 50 and stay with that upper limit regardless of how many links I have.</p>
<p>Another way I am experimenting with tags is in the Simplenote app. It supports tag completion, tags filter. It lets you export all notes to text files (no vendor lock-in). The app is available on iPhone, iPad, and Windows 10. It is open-source, free, and maintained by the maker of Wordpress. Simplenote is my tool of choice for the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/">Zettelkasten</a> method for note keeping. More on that another day.</p>
<p>I should probably start tagging my photos too because the only option I have now is hierarchical navigation (year/month/date) and photos make up 90% of my items. Windows 10 has a built-in search for tags in photos (search with tags:{text}) so the tooling is already there. I just need to start tagging new photos, and find some way of doing it for the 30,000+ past ones!</p>
<p>At work, the use of #tags is problematic with OneNote 2016 because you can’t search for # (it will remove the # and find the keyword returning false positives). The built-in tag system is a pain to use (drop-down menus, dialog boxes). One workaround is to prefix tags with some alphabet instead of # (e.g. zToDo) but this idea doesn’t have traction. We might just go with # and hope a newer OneNote<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> works better.</p>
<p>I have just begun to take tags seriously, it will take time and fine-tuning, but I hope it will give me a useful second option between hierarchical navigation, and full-text search when I try to find things.</p>

<hr /><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2019/11/04/chernobyl/">Chernobyl</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">Nov 04, 2019</p></small>
<p>The wife and I watched HBO’s TV series Chernobyl. At the end of the TV series, it showed real footage of the scientists, politicians, and the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (whatever was left of it). It also tells the story of what happened after. Or does it?</p>
<p>The epilogue of the TV series says the character of Ulana Khomyuk is fictional. That surprised me because the character played a major role as a scientist in containing the damage from the open reactor core, as a fact-finder that pieced together the cause of the disaster, and as a moral compass that convinced Legasov to tell the truth. Her character is meant to represent dozens of scientists that helped. As I was watching the TV series, I did wonder why they had only two scientists helping with the recovery. There must have been so many factors, theories, and simulations to work through. Where did all the Soviet scientists go?</p>
<p>The HBO TV series isn’t a documentary, it is a historical drama based on real events. Putting all that into five episodes requires creative liberties. But they did name it <em>Chernobyl</em> after the real <em>Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</em> where the incident happened. The trailer of the TV series says it is "BASED ON THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY". Actual dates and names of real people are used. As I watched the five-part episodes, I came to think of it as a documentary, believing everything to be realistic. It was very well made, kept me fully engaged throughout, made me think, feel, admire, and empathise. It certainly deserves all the critical acclaim and awards. I would likely watch it again.</p>
<p>Curious about the details of the real disaster, and what happened after, I went to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)">Wikipedia articles</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl</a> was educational but it also challenged the authenticity of many events and characters in the TV series.</p>
<p>Here are some things that aren’t accurate or are completely fictional.</p>
<h3>Death toll</h3>
<p>In the epilogue, it says "Most estimates range from 4,000 to 93,000 deaths". That is a very large range, and the upper limit is especially suspect. According to the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster">article</a>, the number of deaths is contested due to lack of consensus among various government and international groups that have attempted to calculate it. I did see the figures of 4,000 (immediate and long-term deaths) but the upper-end estimates reach 16,000. Nowhere did I read anything close to 93,000!</p>
<p>16,000 to 93,000 is a serious inflation, and I will try to erase that number from my memory.</p>
<h3>The Bridge of Death</h3>
<p>A powerful, sad, and memorable image from the TV series are of the residents of Pripyat standing on a bridge to see the burning Chernobyl power plant. Per the epilogue, none of them survived. This is not true according to Adam Higginbotham who spent a decade researching Chernobyl and wrote a book about it. He interviewed someone who was on that bridge and is <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/05/the-human-drama-of-chernobyl/">still alive</a>. It is possible <em>everyone</em> on that bridge watching the burning power plant didn't die.</p>
<p>This one will be hard to forget.</p>
<h3>Threat of force</h3>
<p>In episode 1, Anatoly Sitnikov is forced by an armed guard to go to the roof and confirm if Reactor Core 4 exploded or not. He didn't want to go because the radiation measurements maxed out, and he saw what he thought were graphite pieces from the Reactor Core on the ground outside the building.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/06/04/the-pain-doesn-t-fade">one</a> account, this isn't true. He went to inspect it willingly because he was familiar with the reactor, and like others, he wanted to help contain the damage. By other accounts, in 1980s USSR, bureaucrats couldn't just order armed guards to force people into doing things against their will.</p>
<h3>Watch but take an antidote</h3>
<p>If I didn’t read Wikipedia articles and the TV series was the only source of information about Chernobyl, then, over time, that would have settled in as fact, and history. It would likely have influenced my opinion about the Soviet Union, about the role of bureaucrats, scientists etc.</p>
<p>I would rewatch the TV series because I tend to miss many things the first time. But I will watch it the way I read opinion pieces in newspapers. Take it as one person's opinion made with news events arranged to influence the reader in a particular way.</p>
<p>My kids watch a lot of YouTube and they tend to believe what the videos show. It is a constant challenge for me to remind them that everything they watch isn’t real, or true. I keep repeating that YouTube is for entertainment only. But I feel like I am on the losing side of this.</p>
<p>Of course, I keep thinking about limiting or completely blocking YouTube. Often, I force them to stop and watch Netflix or Crave instead. Yes, we’ve reached the point where binging on Netflix is the lesser of two evils. They watch it the same way they read storybooks and comics. But they take YouTube videos seriously.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Jul 05, 2019</p></small>
<p>A friend emailed me <a href="http://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html">Einstein's riddle</a>. He said it took him 25 mins to solve. That gave me a bit of motivation to give it a try. I was at my son's swimming lesson when I read the email and quickly realised that I wasn't going to beat his time. But, as I started solving it with Google Sheets on the iPhone, the idea of using database tables and Sql to generate cartesian product, followed by a process of filtering out untrue data got me intrigued.</p>
<p>It took me well over an hour but it worked and it was fun. <em>Stop</em> here and go to the riddle page linked above if you want to give it try.</p>
<p>I used a Sqlite database and below Sql to solve it.</p>

<hr /><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2019/05/25/minecraft-editions/">Minecraft Editions</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">May 25, 2019</p></small>
<p>To celebrate the new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/earth">Minecraft Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/10th-anniversary">10 years of Minecraft</a>, I wanted to go down memory lane and revisit all the Minecraft items that I bought, downloaded and installed over the years for my son Aiden<sup>*</sup>.</p>
<p>First came the Minecraft "Pocket Edition" iPad app (2014), then he got an Xbox 360 gaming console (2015) so I had to buy a Minecraft "Xbox 360" game DVD. </p>
<p>That is two different Minecraft items.</p>
<p>At some point in 2017, Aiden wanted to play Minecraft on the Windows PC because it had a keyboard and many features that the Xbox 360 one didn't. When I saw Minecraft "Windows 10" edition was on sale for $15, I didn't waste any time getting it.</p>
<p>The four-year-old iPad 3 was too slow, so we got an iPad Pro. Fortunately, I didn't have to buy yet another Minecraft as the previous iPad app could be restored at no cost.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Aiden could play Minecraft on a touchscreen iPad, with a gaming controller on the Xbox, and keyboard on the Windows PC.</p>
<p>In January of 2018, I got tired of my kids fighting over the new iPad, so we bought a Kindle tablet from Amazon. Yes! I bought Minecraft for the Kindle too.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I made the dumbest move yet when I let Aiden play Fortnite on my Windows PC. The PC didn't have enough horsepower to run modern games smoothly. Fortnite worked but under lower graphics settings which bothered me more than him. Xbox 360 was the best gaming device we had but it was three years old so new games like Fortnite wasn't made to work on it. Doubling down on my dumbest move, I got the latest generation Xbox One S gaming console to replace Xbox 360, so he could play Fortnite in all its glory. </p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft <a href="https://www.Xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-one/backward-compatibility">didn't bother</a> to make the Minecraft "Xbox 360" game work on the Xbox One. For six months, Fortnite possessed my son completely and he didn't play Minecraft much. When he did play, it was on the Windows PC. It didn't bother him that he couldn't play Minecraft on the Xbox One. Not yet.</p>
<p>So, Minecraft was available on the Windows PC, iPad Pro, and Kindle, but not on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>The Fortnite fever eventually subsided and he started grumbling about not being able to play Minecraft on the Xbox One. Since giving my son <em>every</em> possible Minecraft option on every floor of the house, on all screens was very important to me, I shelled out $30 for Minecraft for Xbox One edition in early 2019.</p>
<p>With that, he could play Minecraft on the iPad, Kindle, Windows PC, and Xbox One (Xbox 360 was packed away but on standby).</p>
<p>Aiden typically plays Minecraft online with his friends and sometimes with his sister Adele. All the above Minecrafts can connect to each other and join the same "world". It seemed like we had it all covered. He was able to play with everyone: school mates, other friends, soccer &amp; hockey buddies, and online "friends".</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, one of his school mates got a Minecraft "Java" edition. The "Java" edition only connects to other "Java" editions. You can install it on Windows 10, but it is different from the "Windows 10" edition that we have! The "Java" edition players connect to a different world than the Xbox/iPad/Kindle/Windows 10 one. My son can't play with him!</p>
<p>The rest of the story is unwritten.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup><small><em>my daughter Adele plays too but occasionally</em>.</small></p>

<small><p class="post-date">Feb 16, 2019</p></small>
<p>Last night at the movies, after sitting down in theatre 9 to watch Aquaman with the wife, we felt like having coffee. So I went back down to get one. Not being experienced with movie going at the theatres, I wasn't sure if I could exit and re-enter so I asked the guy scanning tickets at the entrance and he said yes, but, he also said, "No, thank you!", "I don't need any coffee". He said it without any expression but I had a laugh and he smiled back :)</p>
<p>I probably will not remember <em>Aquaman</em> but that guy, he was funny. When I came back with the coffee, he said "I told you, I don't need coffee. Thank you"</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Nov 14, 2018</p></small>
<p>Getting a 4K monitor (Dell UP2414Q) working with Windows 10 took a lot more than I expected. My computer motherboard supports 4K resolution @ 30 Hz via HDMI but most people online say 4K @ 30 Hz will not be smooth. Having used monitors at 60 Hz refresh rate for as long as I can remember, I didn't want to take a chance and got the graphics card (AMD RX 460) that supports 4K @ 60 Hz via DisplayPort.</p>
<p>When I powered up the 4K monitor, I saw the sharp, colour accurate, bright, and "retina" 4K display that I was expecting but it was running at 30 Hz. It was usable, and I didn't notice any lag. Still, I wanted to get the refresh rate to 60 Hz for <em>best</em> results. There was just no way to pick 4K @ 60 Hz.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to find the answer online. The monitor's <em>DisplayPort 1.2</em> was disabled (default setting). Enabling it via the monitor menu refreshed the available resolutions and refresh rates and I was able to pick 3840 x 2160 (4K) @ 60 Hz. It was noticeably smoother than 30 Hz, so the internet people were right.</p>
<p>Then I ran into another problem: when the monitor powered back on after sleep, the screen would split into two with the left half at a lower resolution and stretched out (the right half was fine). It was not usable at all. This problem took a while to figure out including time wasted trying Dell's customer support.</p>
<p>Again, changing a monitor setting solved it. Only this time, I disabled the setting called <em><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/630555/turning-displayport-monitor-off-disables-monitor-completely">DDC/CI</a></em>.</p>
<p>I still have one unsolved problem, but it is easy to work around. When Windows turns off the monitor to enter sleep mode, it stops sending the signal via the DisplayPort. I can't <em>wake</em> the monitor up using keyboard or mouse. When I power on the monitor, it still doesn't get any display signal from the computer. This thing drove me crazy for about an hour (monitor connected via HDMI doesn't have this problem). I finally gave up trying to make this work. Instead, I don't let Windows power off the monitor. I do it myself by pressing the power button.</p>
<p>What I learnt is a DisplayPort connection between monitor and computer isn't a simple one-way connection like it is with VGA or DVI. DisplayPort is a two-way connection meaning the monitor sends back data about its capabilities to the computer every time it powers up and the computer then figures out what signal to send (much like a USB printer or mouse). When the computer puts the monitor to sleep and wakes it back up, something goes wrong in that connection negotiation and I end up with either a half screen unusable display or completely off monitor.</p>
<p>Having to physically press the power button on the monitor to turn it off and on is something new for me but I don't mind it.</p>
<p>Update: I still get the no-signal or split screen randomly, To fix it, I change Input Source to HDMI, wait, then switch it back to DisplayPort and it works</p>

<p>My son has two dictionaries: Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary, and The Kid Dictionary. The Kid Dictionary has made up words to describe the indescribable and it is hilarious!</p>
<p>I don't remember him ever using the Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary and I doubt it is still around.</p>
<p>The other night, while reading the story of The Brave Little Tailor (again) to my daughter at bedtime, I was sleepy and skipped a few paragraphs on the last page. My son, who was also in bed but listening, jumped up and told me to pause.</p>
<p>He went to his bookshelf, pulled out The Kid Dictionary, flipped over to page 40, then read out loud: CHAPTURN (verb). "To sneakily skip pages when reading a long children's book to your kid."</p>
<p>Then, turning to page 41, he read: CHAPTURKEY (noun). "A parent who gets caught skipping pages when reading a long children's book to his or her kid".</p>

<p><em>Fly hacking</em> is a Minecraft term used to describe cheating by a player in a multi-player online game. I learnt this from my son who goes online into Minecraft worlds and plays games with others. To keep it fun, competitive, and fair, players aren't allowed to fly in the games. Flying gives a player unfair advantages. They are supposed to battle on the ground. But there are players who hack into the Minecraft system and fly. When this happens, someone reports them to the server admin and the cheating player gets kicked out of the game.</p>
<p>In Game of Thrones, Daenerys Targaryen has three fire-breathing dragons that give her the same advantage in battles. When she and her soldiers are surrounded by opponents and there is no way out, in flies her Dragon breathing fire, burning people, scaring the pee out of shocked men. She climbs on it and flies out of, what a few moments ago, was a certain death. The Sons of the Harpy had no option to complain about the unfair advantage of a Dragon.</p>
<p>Air strikes in war, giant-sized Eagles in Lord of the Rings, there are many other examples in fiction and reality where one side has an unfair advantage over another. Unlike Minecraft, there is no way to level the playing field.</p>

<p>Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a time to get together with friends and family, exchange presents, take time off from work, and refresh before the new year.</p>
<p>It is also a time to look back at the year that past, consider how it was spent, memories made, remember those that have pass.</p>
<p>My family brings me joy, meaning, and purpose to my life. But I also miss the family that I am part of but are oceans away: my parents, brothers, and the extended family in India. </p>
<p>This is an immigrant's pain. An immigrant's sacrifice. An immigrant's bargain.</p>
<p>It is the asterisk that has been there for the past 12 years, in all the headlines of my life, reminding me of the family that I left as I embarked on new life in Canada to make my own.</p>
<p>I miss them, wish them well, and pray for them.</p>

<p>Adele didn't want to finish her lunch(old news). She wanted to skip to the drink (Sprite). She started with her usual excuses but realised it wasn't working. So she came up with a new one.</p>
<p>She said: In my stomach, the <em>food section</em> is full but the <em>drink section</em> still has space.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
