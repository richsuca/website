<small><p class="post-date">May 03, 2020</p></small>
<p>Some random observations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thanks to Zoom meetings, I got to see people for the first time. I have worked with them for years, talked over the phone, chatted, emailed, but only seen outdated profile photos before. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks to Facebook, my mother-in-law has started and kept an Indian food festival going. This has necessitated a regular run at the treadmill too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chinese:Indian food ratio was 3:1 before the lockdown. It's been reversed! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We played a lot of card games for the first few weeks: UNO, pair matching, poker, and rummy. Poker was a new game for us. I liked it but it was too serious. UNO is the clear favourite. The <a href="https://github.com/richsuca/memorygame">pair matching</a> game exposed my poor remembering ability as I kept losing to everyone. Card games have since gone out of fashion. Maybe the arrival of Taboo will change things. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Calendar app has become irrelevant. Now we just have working days and non-working days. The calendar entries do remind me of an alternative non-pandemic dimension. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Face ID irrelevant. The wife has the only device with Face ID but it doesn't work with masks on, so I have had to pay with my Touch ID phone a few times. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gas prices irrelevant. From $1.40+/liter before the pandemic to $0.80/liter, and with most places closed (including offices), there is not much driving happening. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My computer moved to my bedroom. At night, the tiny blue led of the NUM Lock creates a disproportionately large circle of blue light on the ceiling. I kept staring at it and got sleep deprived. I finally covered it up with something<sup id="fnref:lockdownran1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lockdownran1">1</a></sup>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WhatsApp was already the de facto messaging app, it became essential during the lockdown. WhatsApp used to be $1/year, then FaceBook made it free hoping to use ads to make money. No ads yet but I am sure it's coming. I wish they just charged for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of Toronto and likely many other cities are doing schooling using Google Classroom. It has its limitations but works well overall. This is another area where Microsoft had everything but just couldn't get it to work together. They already give free Windows 10 Education Edition and Office to students. They have online versions of their Office apps. I guess they are missing a Classroom app that ties it all together. Even if kids go back to school, I can't see <em>all</em> of them in school together, so distance learning is here to stay. It will be interesting to see how things play out. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got an Apple Pencil (1st gen) a few years ago but it didn't see regular use. There is no off button so it keeps running out of charge, and charging is awkward<sup id="fnref:lockdownran2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lockdownran2">2</a></sup>. But under lockdown, it has seen regular use, especially for classwork. It has also seen increased use for handwriting, for recreational art, almost all in the <a href="https://paper.bywetransfer.com/">Paper</a> app. For classwork, it has saved a lot of paper and eliminated the print-write-scan cycle for my daughter. Now that we use it more, we are in a habit of keeping it charged too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wife asked her niece <em>so tomorrow you have school?</em> She replied <em>I have classes, not school</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:lockdownran1">
<p>If I switched it off, it would have <em>woken</em> up the computer and I would have had to stare at the big Windows wallpaper instead! After that night, I make it a point to turn off Num Lock when I am done using the computer.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lockdownran1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-charge-your-apple-pencil">two</a> ways to charge it. Both are badly designed. Plus, Apple Pencil is round-shaped so it rolls on a flat surface. But it works great. Very similar to a real pencil.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lockdownran2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<small><p class="post-date">Apr 25, 2020</p></small>
<p>It's been over a month since we went into COVID-19 lockdown. With the help of various apps and websites, we can work, study, learn, and attend mass. It has been fascinating to observe how different organizations find ways to keep things going remotely.</p>
<p>The list of apps we are using<sup id="fnref:remote4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remote4">4</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Citrix</li>
<li>Google Classroom</li>
<li>Cisco WebEx</li>
<li>Whereby</li>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the first and uber essential one: Citrix</p>
<h3>Citrix</h3>
<p>The wife and I both use Citrix to connect to our remote work computers. It works so well I forget the computer I am using is thousands of miles away in a data center. With rare exceptions, there is no lag in the screen, keyboard, or mouse response. Even when my home internet disconnects briefly, Citrix resumes without us having to redo the connection steps. The underlying Citrix <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/ica">tech</a> is magical. I can even print from my remote work computer to my home printer!</p>
<p>We remote to the work Windows computers in many ways, and it all works </p>
<ul>
<li>Two monitors</li>
<li>4K display<sup id="fnref:remote3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remote3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>MacBook<sup id="fnref:remote1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remote1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>iPad<sup id="fnref:remote2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remote2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>When I started working from home over 10 years ago, I was using Citrix remoting to a Windows XP computer. Everything worked except when I opened a PDF file or watched videos. These two were painfully slow. I can still picture the words in the PDF files stretching and bleeding virtual ink as I scrolled through the page very slowly. The work around for the videos were to make the video dimensions small, like a thumbnail. Fortunately, I didn't have to do either of them often.</p>
<p>At some point, my work computer got upgraded to Windows 7 and that solved both the problems. Then I got myself a 4K display at home and created a new problem. The text didn't scale well with Windows 7 so I had to manually adjust font sizes in the apps to make it look normal. The toolbar icons in many apps became tiny and there was no way to resize them.</p>
<p>I was lucky with the timing. Few months later, I heard about a pilot for Windows 10 and I harassed some people to get me one at work. The 4K display with Citrix connected to remote Windows 10 computer eliminated 90% of the text and icon sizing problems!</p>
<p>Time heals everything. I take it for granted but the minions in Redmond are hard at work making every release of Windows better. Windows 10 is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>Requires extra patience. I don't like the feel of the MacBook Air keyboard, and many frequently used Windows keyboard shortcuts don't work with the Citrix connection either because keys don't map properly or keys are missing entirely.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:remote1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:remote2">
<p>Requires patience. I was able to work a whole day with an external keyboard and Citrix's cute little onscreen mouse on the 10.5" iPad connected to my work Windows computer. The screen isn't as limiting as I imagined. I was able to do programming, emails, Excel, and surprisingly drag things around to change the layout in a workflow tool. Some would call it <em>Zen mode</em>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:remote2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:remote3">
<p>At screen refresh rate of 30hz, which is smooth enough that I don't even notice anymore. When I first started using the 4K display with Citrix, I had the office sys admins change the default screen refresh to 60hz, it was smoother than 30hz but Skype screen sharing kept crashing, and no one had any idea, so I reverted it to 30hz. Skype still crashes (really sucks) but I stayed with 30hz.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:remote3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<small><p class="post-date">Apr 02, 2020</p></small>
<p>I went to the grocery store yesterday.</p>
<p>Things I touched</p>
<ul>
<li>The letterbox (posted a survey from Costco<sup id="fnref:covid19-ftr-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:covid19-ftr-1">1</a></sup>)</li>
<li>The shopping cart</li>
<li>All the items I picked up</li>
<li>Fridge door for the milk</li>
<li>Fridge door for the ice cream</li>
<li>Plastic divider at the checkout counter<sup id="fnref:covid19-ftr-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:covid19-ftr-2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>The chain to link the shopping carts</li>
</ul>
<p>The local grocery store is relatively smaller so there are many narrow corners and aisles. I was within 3 feet of people a few times.</p>
<p>I sanitized my hands at the entrance, sanitized it again after I returned the cart.</p>
<p>At the checkout counter, I felt itchy on my cheek and scratched it, then realized the horror of what I did 😨.</p>
<p>After reaching home, I looked at all the food items and wondered: how do I sanitize them?! I didn't.</p>
<p>We touch so many things that are touched by others. Unless we completely stop going out or accepting deliveries, I can't think of a way to avoid it. I guess it is a matter of reducing probabilities. No wonder the US and Canada are heading towards mass infections and deaths.</p>

<hr /><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/03/15/tags/">Finding Things</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">Mar 15, 2020</p></small>
<p>Digital things of value to me are in many places (Emails, Google Docs, PC documents, iPhone). At work, we use Wiki, SharePoint, Emails, documents in network drives, tickets, and recently OneNote as an information store. </p>
<p>Finding things is a challenge.</p>
<p>There are three ways I find things (in order of preference):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to a specific location</li>
<li>Full-text search</li>
<li>Ask someone</li>
</ol>
<p>Often, I will use more than one of the above to get to the information I am looking for. For example, I'll go to a specific Google Drive folder where I keep my scanned paper receipts, then do a full-text search <sup id="fnref:tag1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tag1">1</a></sup> with the item or store name to find it. Or, at work, I will ask my colleague where to look for something, and I will learn it is in a certain folder in SharePoint, once I navigate to the folder, it is easy to browse through the documents and find it. Option 3 isn’t available at home.</p>
<p>Going to a specific location (my first tendency) requires hierarchical storage, like books in a library (room, aisle, shelf). Find things is a process of elimination.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone &gt; Notes app &gt; Folders (browse) &gt; Note (browse) </li>
<li>PC &gt; Documents &gt; Pictures &gt; 2019 &gt; (browse) &gt; (scroll through large thumbnails)</li>
</ul>
<p>To find things faster, the obvious solution is to have fewer options at every step of the hierarchy and that means more consolidation. At home, I plan to reorganize and move things into just three places: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a><sup id="fnref:tag2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tag2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Documents folder in the PC</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be ideal if it was just 1,2 and I didn’t need 3 but I don’t feel comfortable putting <em>everything</em> into Google (or equivalent), yet. Likewise, at work, we are also moving all digital things into OneNote. Looking forward to that.</p>
<p>One major problem with hierarchical storage: when the location of things isn’t obvious, where does it go? (do you organize photos by year/month/date folder hierarchy or by subject: kids, places, food). It will be harder to find no matter how you choose. Either it will be tedious, or you will go down the wrong path and don’t find it at all, because where you decided to search wasn’t the same place you decided to put it.</p>
<p>Full-text search is very powerful, but it tends to be slow and returns irrelevant results. You also can’t search for non-text things<sup id="fnref:tag3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tag3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So hierarchical navigation is my favourite, but it has its disadvantages, whereas full-text search has a wider reach, but it has problems too.</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>What is missing in my methods is labels or tags. </p>
<p>The only place where I have them is <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>. As of last week, I had over a thousand website links in Pinboard and 300+ tags for them, but whenever I went looking for links, I just browsed the list of links page-by-page or did a full-text search. Filtering by tags, despite being a prominent feature and easy to use, was the last resort.</p>
<p>The main advantage of tags over hierarchical storage is an object can have many tags (one-to-many). A photo can only exist in one folder (hierarchy) but it can have many tags (location, rating, names). I don’t like complexity, and tags are complex and arbitrary. That’s why I had so many useless tags (interview, park, review, video) in Pinboard. Tags weren’t important to me, so I didn’t name them well, because I had useless tags, I didn’t use them to find things.</p>
<p>I need to put more care into the naming of tags and refine them periodically. But I didn’t bother till recently when I read an article about the <a href="https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand">Zettlekasten</a> method of keeping notes. Tags play a key role in that method. </p>
<p><a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/">Sasha Fast</a> recommends naming tags by objects, not topic. Topic tags have a weaker connection, results in wider search, and don’t age as well as object-based tags.</p>
<p>e.g. of topic tags<br>
idea, funny, quote</p>
<p>Tags named after <em>objects</em> referenced in the digital thing (note, photo) will result in better search relevance and are durable (years later, it will still mean the same), but they tend to have narrow use (tags are used only once), and you end up with a large number of tags.</p>
<p>e.g. of object tags<br>
kids, caroline, NHL</p>
<p>So, a good tag must strike a balance between a topic and <em>object</em> to find the right scope of relevance. </p>
<p>This brings me to the second realization about useful tagging systems, all the tags should fit into one screen, be easy to browse through, and shouldn’t need a filter or search to find. If it is made into a tag cloud, the tags would still be readable, not requiring any squinting. I have decided on the arbitrary upper limit of 50 tags. A periodic review of tags will keep it relevant and keep the number at or below 50.</p>
<p>The third thing about tags is to avoid applying too many tags to an object. I am still early in my tagging process, but I feel this will keep tag count under control and simplify decision making.</p>
<p>I used to think of tags as keywords to add that I can full-text search for, and that made me add many tags to an item. Now I think of tags as a shortlist of predefined labels that I will use to filter things. Filter , not search.</p>
<p>Guided by what I learnt; I have reduced my Pinboard tags from 300+ to under 80 with the help of a homemade <a href="https://github.com/richsuca/Retag/releases">desktop app</a>. I intend to <em><a href="https://konmari.com/">konmari</a></em> it down to less than 50 and stay with that upper limit regardless of how many links I have.</p>
<p>Another way I am experimenting with tags is in the Simplenote app. It supports tag completion, tags filter. It lets you export all notes to text files (no vendor lock-in). The app is available on iPhone, iPad, and Windows 10. It is open-source, free, and maintained by the maker of Wordpress. Simplenote is my tool of choice for the Zettelkasten method for note keeping. More on that another day.</p>
<p>I should probably start tagging my photos too because the only option I have now is hierarchical navigation (year/month/date) and photos make up 90% of my items. Windows 10 has a built-in search for tags in photos (search with tags:{text}) so the tooling is already there. I just need to start tagging new photos, and find some way of doing it for the 30,000+ past ones!</p>
<p>At work, the use of #tags is problematic with OneNote 2016 because you can’t search for # (it will remove the # and find the keyword returning false positives). The built-in tag system is a pain to use (drop-down menus, dialog boxes). One workaround is to prefix tags with some alphabet instead of # (e.g. zToDo) but this idea doesn’t have traction. We might just go with # and hope a newer OneNote<sup id="fnref:tag4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tag4">4</a></sup> works better.</p>
<p>I have just begun to take tags seriously, it will take time and fine-tuning, but I hope it will give me a useful second option between hierarchical navigation, and full-text search when I try to find things.</p>
