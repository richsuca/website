was reading an article on joelonsoftware and came across this word. I had no idea how to pronounce it, let alone make a guess at its meaning. Its one of those words that, just can't be guessed at.<br /><br />What's the meaning ? how to pronounce ? go to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=lagniappe">dictionary.com</a>

<p>Jul 20, 2005</p>
<p>The advantage of living in a developed country like Canada can be illustrated by how long one takes to save up for an iPod mini. A guy i know recently bought an iPod mini from Apple.com for about Canadian$ 260. How long does it take to save C$ 260 ?</p>
<p>The official minimum salary is about C$ 8 per hour. So you are guaranteed to get C$ 8 per hour or more. Most people get more. Still, say you get C$ 8/hour for 40 hours a week [which again is standard], you end up with C$ 320!!, of course you have to subtract taxes etc.</p>
<p>Even at the maximum [30%], at minimum salary, one can save C$ 224 a week. With this, one can buy a reconditioned iPod mini for C$ ~190 OR work one more day and buy a brand new iPod mini from Apple.com.</p>
<p>I don't think there is much to say about, by Indian minimum salary standards, how long would it take to save up for iPod mini [Rs. ~11,000 according to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.in/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=104136&amp;item=5789403630&amp;rd=1">eBay India</a>].</p>
<p>No. I am not buying one [I am unemployed right now, so I can only save C$ 0.00]</p>

I was setting up Gemini Bug Tracking on Sql Server 2005 and had hit a few problems [problem == challenge] while Caroline was busy selecting and searching the songs to put into the compilation. But, the aunt in question is scheduled to leave day after and that meant I couldn't procrastinate any more. So some effort was initiated at building up a few CDs with instrumentals [from my collection], some Cliff Richard's popular hits and few popular songs.<br /><br />When I put one of the compiled CD in the audio system [Technics, multi speaker, surround], it played and we were treated to songs which brought a smile to Aunt's face. She was on the phone with her son and she put the phone near the speaker to let her son hear it!! It was gratifying to see her happy with this little effort of ours and thats what this blog is about [in case, you were wondering].<br /><br />Now I am happy that I did the Cds. Its simple little things like this that makes life worth living. It has made me positive and a little more lively [being jobless has supressed most of my humor for quiet sometime now].<br /><br />Music is great.

<p>Jul 14, 2005</p>
This weblog will be a way to reach my friends and family at home. To help bring about some connection between my life and that of my family and friends. Time flies by and with this weblog, I hope to be able to make things more interesting, memorable and hopefully more honest.<br /><br />'Just a minute' ? well, i have been procrastinating with just about everything in life, job search, calling people up, writing mails etc. and thought that this blog will make me take at least one minute a day [or in a few days] to sit down and <span style="font-weight:bold;">think</span>.<br /><br />Feel free to share this blog with others who might be interested to hear from me. I will appreciate if you take time and write a comment. Thanks.<br /><br />remember, the website is <span style="font-weight:bold;">"richardhsu.net/weblog"</span>
