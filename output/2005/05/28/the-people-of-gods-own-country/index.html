<p>Friends of mine already know what I think about Kerala and its people, especially Kochi [Cochin]. Its the most beautiful place that I have ever visited. No wonder, someone came up with &quot;God's own country&quot; as a way to describe this green carpeted state. But its not only the land scape or the natural beauty that is nice about Kerala, its also the people here.</p>
<p>Keralites are mostly honest, civilised and nice people. This I state in comparison to people in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Maharashtra and a few other states that I know a little bit about. This is an entirely personal opinion [as it always is].</p>
<p>Just last night, on the train from Chennai to Ernakulam [Cochin], the air conditioning in the coach I was in was not working and there was a married couple with a sweet little daughter and the poor child couldn't tolerate the heat in the air tight AC coach. My other co-passengers were also very uneasy but then, most of the people travelling were from Kerala [most were Malayalis] and so they showed patience and acknowledged the efforts the railway folks were making to fix the AC. I didn't hear any shouting or abuse, the kind that we can expect from a people from other parts of the country, especially my home state Bengal. I look 100% Chinese [read: foreigner] and in all my stay in Cochin, in hotels, while traveling in auto rickshaws, buying things from shops, I have never come across a person who tried to cheat me or fool me given that I am not a local. Trust me, I would know if they tried it. Contrast this to Chennai, Kolkata. Mumbai and other cities where railway stations are filled with touts and crooks.</p>
