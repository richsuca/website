<small><p class="post-date">Mar 16, 2005</p></small>
<p>I just viewed the short documentary &quot;The Legend of Fat Mama-Stories from Calcutta's Melting 'Wok' &quot;. Its shows the Indian Chinese at Kolkata and covers our food habbits, new year celebrations and also the India-China war of 1962. Its amazing that a small and insignificant community like ours would interest people enough to be aired on BBC World. But I must point something out, in the documentary, it talks a lot of about 1962 war with China and the ill treatment to the Indian Chinese at that time.</p>
<p>To set the records straight, India is amongst one of the world's best places for anybody to live in. Inspite of the communal problems, its a place where anybody could settle and prosper without any hindrances. Of course, as its a developing country, the ills of corruption and uncivilized conduct of some people will be felt occasionally but then this applies to all Indians and not just to Indian Chinese. I have never really felt any issues arising out of the war on our generation and I am positive it didn't affect anyone of the generation before me either. As a proof, one only needs to look at the general economic condition of the Indian Chinese. I am proud to be Indian and also proud of my Chinese origins. There is no conflict or problems at all.</p>
<p>Since June 2004, I have been to Kochi[Cochin], Chennai, Bangalore, Dubai [U.A.E] and Ghana and my travels have only reconfirmed my above statements. India is a good place to be in. If people in our community are migrating, its purely because western countries offer better life style [social security, health care, less corruption etc. etc.] and not because we have been ill treated or something. We are migrating for the same reasons as Malayalis going to the Dubai or Sadarjis to Canada.</p>
