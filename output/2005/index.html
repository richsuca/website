<small><p class="post-date">Nov 29, 2005</p></small>
Sometimes, at around 2-3 in the afternoon, the sun comes around to tease me. I sit near the window and there is a window at an angle of 10 o'clock. This window has blinds but the mechanism for dropping the blinds is defective and therefore try as I may, it doesn't drop. So I give up and just let the sun's light shine into my eyes for about 30 mins. Sometimes, some clouds dark and white come to my rescue and blocks it for a while, but the sun oh, the mighty relentless sun doesn't give up. What I am forced to do is sit a little left [inconveniently I might add] so that the wall between the windows blocks the sunrays.<br /><br />But its something thats welcome because its really really cold now about -2 or lesser.

<small><p class="post-date">Nov 17, 2005</p></small>
Today, around 2pm at work, someone mentioned "its snowing" and my head turned to the window. It was not snowing as heavily as in winter, rather it was very light snow, called flurries [Caroline introduced me to this word]. Caroline aptly provided an analogy that this was like a snow drizzle. But I could see it, and it was beautiful, the opposite building's black colour provided an excellent background and contrast to it. I stopped whatever I was doing and went to the window. I told my colleagues nearby that I am seeing snow for the first time and they all smiled and were very happy for me. I remember seeing the white snow bouncing off the outer edge of the window and it was a nice sight. Someday soon, it will snow again and I will hope to make a photo of it. Better, I pray that God let everyone witness it personally.<br /><br />Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..

<small><p class="post-date">Nov 16, 2005</p></small>
If you like your job, stick with it. the next job that you think you will like more, probably will suck and you'll end up regretting and working hard every sec, every hour, every day without really being productive.</p>
<p>My job currently involves sending out mortgage docs. Sometimes there are a lot of docs to send out, sometimes there are very few and you have free time. But most of the days I get just about enough work to keep me busy for the whole day. When I get a lot of docs to send, I typically start applying optimisations to the way I work. Ok, I am not about to discuss the patented techniques I use but suffice it to say that batching things, doing top priority things first, putting my eggs in many baskets and looking ahead do help me finish things on time.</p>
<p>Lets talk about each of them in more detail:-
a) <strong> Batching things</strong>: Instead of going through my normal step 1, step 2, step 3 with each doc, I avoid step 1 and step 3 and only do step 2 for every doc. I postpone step 1 till a few days later while I do step 3 for all the docs together at the end of day. This helps speed up the process a lot because I reduce the time needed by switching contexts.</p>
<p>Ok, you are falling asleep already. Don't fall a sleep yet. Let me try to explain my optimisations in a different way.</p>
<p>Since I can't talk about what I do at work, I will use an analogy to explain it. Say we are in a Chinese restaurant and my job is to do doing take-outs or what in India we would call parcels/packing.</p>
<p>So the process goes like this:
1) a customer is hungry and comes in to order food.
2) the cashier takes the order and money.
3) since the order is taken with a carbon paper, there are two copies of it.
4) one copy goes into the kitchen for the chef to cook and prepare the meal.
5) the second order comes to me.  my job is to pack the food, include the napkins [also known as tissue/serviets/cleenex here], paper plates and plastic disposable spoon &amp; forks [if requested], put in the complementary packets of chilli &amp; soya sauce and ONLY a single packet of the [top secret] chilli vinegar.</p>
<p>At this point, while the chef is also batching things up inside [ie. trying to cook all similar items together] we will take a look at what different methods I can apply in order to handle multiple orders in an efficient way.</p>
<p>So, if we only had a single order at a time, life would be easier and simpler. All I would do is wait for the kitchen to give the individual boxes/containers and I would keep checking with my order list. Once everything in the order list was in, I would stack them up and put them in a plastic carry bag. Then put in the sauce, plastic cutlery etc and tie a neat knot and hand it over to the customer.</p>
<p>But life is never that simple or single threaded [geeky term] so instead of single order at a time, we get many orders at a time and instead of the kitchen processing one order at a time, they give things randomly [the degree of randomness depends on the no. of cooks that is inside the kitchen]. The kitchen will not bring everything out at the same time, they will put things out as they are done.</p>
<p>Ah, you see, now we need a strategy and rethink our process a little bit. We can't apply the same 1,2,3 now. So first, we make sure that we have all the order slips in ascending chronological order. Earlier orders are on top and later ones below it.<strong> Thats prioritising for you. Doing the most important things first</strong>.It is less likely that the person who just placed an order will start question when it will come out [although you will meet with fools like these as well]. But if someone ordered a food 20 mins back, he will get bored standing there [and seeing other people get their food] and ask about his order.</p>
<p>Now that we have the list in order, we could just pick the top of the list and wait for the items to come out from the kitchen. Say the order list reads as follows :-</p>
<p>1 Chilli Chicken [with gravy]
1 Mix Fried Rice [Pork included]</p>
<p>Now, given this order, we are expecting a tin container with chilli chicken and a box of friend rice. One may come out before the other, its not a problem. But what we find is one of the following:-</p>
<p>a) chilli chicken [you wish]
b) 2 chilli chicken
c) 5 chilli chicken
d) chilli chicken [dry, no gravy and the small note saying that this one is without garlic or onions as per order!!]
e) to z) many other possibilities exists which only very imaginative people can figure out or better from real life experience.</p>
<p>Now what do we do ? take the ones we need for this order and keep the others for later guessing that the other orders after this will need it. This will work, except that the next order may just be for only 1 chilli chicken and yet, that person would have to wait for the first order's friend rice to come out before he gets his chilli chicken. Imagine, that the rice is not cooked yet, so the fried rice will take some time and all this while, even though we may have complete items for other orders, we hold it back because we are working only one order at a time. <strong>So don't put all your eggs in one basket</strong>. Don't serialize things that you shouldn't serialize . Think multithreads [geeky again..]. What we do is work on multiple orders at the same time, we lay out as many order lists on the table as space will permit. The earliest order will be on the right and later ones to the left of it [the right side being closer to the kitchen].</p>
<p>Ok, so now when we get if we get something from the kitchen, we start matching them to the orders starting with the right most [earliest] order and moving to the left till we find it being listed in one of the orders. When we find a match, we place it near the list in such a way that we tell that the item is for this list.</p>
<p>This way, first things get done first but it doesn't block the less important things from being done. Given that the kitchen will cook things according to their convenience, we will finish packing more orders this way than the simple way.</p>
<p>Still reading ? good. because we are almost to the end of the story. Just a little more and we are done for today.</p>
<p>The last important technique that helps me is look-ahead. Coming back to packing food, if we just layout the order lists and wait, we would suddenly start scrambling when the first or first few items start coming out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Why ? because if the orders have many items and there are many orders and the kitchen throws out like 10 things at time all of which is not necessarily for the same order, it would be quite difficult to match things to the orders. You can go items-wise or the order-wise. You can pick one item and look at the order list top to bottom, then next order list top to bottom. Or you can pick the first item in the first order list and look at the items that just came out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Say there are two orders:-
1st Order
- 1 chilli chicken
- 1 mix fried rice</p>
<p>2nd Order
- 1 Kung Pao chicken</p>
<p>and the kitchen gives you Kung Pao chicken and mix friend rice together. Then you can either pick one chilli chicken and start looking at the 1st order top down or you can look at the first item in the 1st order and see if is there in the cooked items or not.</p>
<p>I know this one is easy because you have only 2 items in 2 lists and the cooked items are 2 but when you have like 30 items in 15 different orders and the kitchen sends out 7 things at a time, the simple matching approaches discussed above, although correct, will be very slow. So, what to do ?</p>
<p><strong>Anticipate</strong>. Read the first few orders into you head and remember it. While you are finishing an order and reaching out for the sauce packets and spoons etc., start looking at the next order. Because you are an expert and you can do all this without looking, you should have your eyes reading the next order that is not already in your mind forgetting the order you just completed. This way, you don't just stand and staring at the order to memorise it. These small time savings can total to a huge difference in delivery time and its a proven thing. Believe me.</p>
<p>To summarise, I have recently learnt to prioritise, do more than one thing at a time and anticipate which has resulted in me finishing my work faster. Today is one of the rare days when I have not much work to do and so I share this secret with you :-) In retrospect, if I had applied such secrets to my past 4 years in software development, I would, perhaps, be in a totally different place today.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Oct 30, 2005</p></small>
First evening at the apartment. I am tempted to say 'new' apartment as its a totally new experience for us but the apartment is housed in a fairly old building, in fact, it was occupied by some people before us and we can safely assume many more before them. My uncle Lawrence was kind enough to help us carry all the furniture and belongings and also arrange for his friend to bring his truck for moving the stuff. Dennis [Tseng] had moved quite a lot of things already last night into the garrage. Dennis is a genuinely nice guy and one of few people who can sit and have a long chat with Caroline &amp; myself. The stuff we moved in with includes a double bed, a cupboard, a side cupboard, a Sony TV, a really good computer table, a table with 2 chairs, a sofa, 2 phones [one cordless with answering machine], toaster and many many more things which I am able to mention, all given to us by Yun Hua Khew &amp; Khew mei &amp; family. When we finished loading everything into the truck and was saying good bye to Yun Hua Khew &amp; Khew Mei, all of us had tears in our eyes. That says it all. Caroline does get emotional but I hardly do and yet I couldn't help myself when Ah Khew was about to give me a good bye hug. We have been provided with the best of house to stay in when we landed here in Canada, the best of food, cooked by Khew Mei, all the support which all meant that we never had to face any discomfort and felt right at home. May God bless their family and provide us an opportunity in future to be useful to them as well.

<small><p class="post-date">Oct 20, 2005</p></small>
"Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else." -- <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26911.html">James M. Barrie</a><br /><br />This quote cannot be more apt when applied to my present situation.<br /><br />Till about 3 months back [June 2005], I never really did any work. I was employed full-time and paid by technology companies from 2000-2005 for solving problems with computers but it was never 'work'. Honestly, I didn't even realise how time flew by and I had been programming computers professionally for the last 5 years. I don't remember ever feeling like "oh shit, tomorrow's monday". I don't remember feeling relieved and happy to leave office and go home. In fact, for the last 5 years, I may have spent more than 80% of my 'awake time' doing something or the other with computers. If not programming, then reading about technology. Ocassionally, assembling computers or troubleshooting computers at friends and relatives. Everyone who knows me, know that the only thing I know about is computers and thats about the only thing I really like and can talk for hours on end about.<br /><br />Coming back to 'work'. I do work now and have been working for the past 2 months. About a month in the restaurant as waiter and now in a bank's back office doing data entry. It sounds like I am not happy with it but thats not the case. Money is the main consideration now behind my daily efforts. With programming, money was secondary and a bonus. See, the word 'daily' and 'efforts' got associated with work.<br /><br />Programming and technology is a part time hobby now. Also, I have developed an interest in photography which continues to jostle with technology for my 'free' time.<br /><br />Of course, a lazy person like me would prefer not to have to work at all. I have tried to get into technology companies but have not succeeded yet. Maybe next year, some organisation will pay me for having fun with computers again. Until then, I will work.

She basically meant that she didn't trust 'him' at all. The expression was different and 'yucky'.<br /><br />Case 2:<br />A guy to another guy - "I couldn't sleep last night because it was too hot"!!!!!???<br /><br />Did I hear him correct ? "too hot", while we were all dressed up in jackets. Yesterday's weather was between 13 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius [normally the min. temperature-7 degrees is at night, when everybody tries to sleep]. I suspect, most people, like me, in the Greater Toronto Area was under thick blankets last night while this gentleman was sweating sleepless!! Man, is everything in the world relative, cold for one is hot for another [maybe he is the only 'another' amongst the millions of Toronto residents :-)]

<small><p class="post-date">Jul 20, 2005</p></small>
<p>The advantage of living in a developed country like Canada can be illustrated by how long one takes to save up for an iPod mini. A guy i know recently bought an iPod mini from Apple.com for about Canadian$ 260. How long does it take to save C$ 260 ?</p>
<p>The official minimum salary is about C$ 8 per hour. So you are guaranteed to get C$ 8 per hour or more. Most people get more. Still, say you get C$ 8/hour for 40 hours a week [which again is standard], you end up with C$ 320!!, of course you have to subtract taxes etc.</p>
<p>Even at the maximum [30%], at minimum salary, one can save C$ 224 a week. With this, one can buy a reconditioned iPod mini for C$ ~190 OR work one more day and buy a brand new iPod mini from Apple.com.</p>
<p>I don't think there is much to say about, by Indian minimum salary standards, how long would it take to save up for iPod mini [Rs. ~11,000 according to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.in/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=104136&amp;item=5789403630&amp;rd=1">eBay India</a>].</p>
<p>No. I am not buying one [I am unemployed right now, so I can only save C$ 0.00]</p>

I was setting up Gemini Bug Tracking on Sql Server 2005 and had hit a few problems [problem == challenge] while Caroline was busy selecting and searching the songs to put into the compilation. But, the aunt in question is scheduled to leave day after and that meant I couldn't procrastinate any more. So some effort was initiated at building up a few CDs with instrumentals [from my collection], some Cliff Richard's popular hits and few popular songs.<br /><br />When I put one of the compiled CD in the audio system [Technics, multi speaker, surround], it played and we were treated to songs which brought a smile to Aunt's face. She was on the phone with her son and she put the phone near the speaker to let her son hear it!! It was gratifying to see her happy with this little effort of ours and thats what this blog is about [in case, you were wondering].<br /><br />Now I am happy that I did the Cds. Its simple little things like this that makes life worth living. It has made me positive and a little more lively [being jobless has supressed most of my humor for quiet sometime now].<br /><br />Music is great.

Time flies by and with this weblog, I hope to be able to make things more interesting, memorable and hopefully more honest.<br /><br />'Just a minute' ? well, i have been procrastinating with just about everything in life, job search, calling people up, writing mails etc. and thought that this blog will make me take at least one minute a day [or in a few days] to sit down and <span style="font-weight:bold;">think</span>.<br /><br />Feel free to share this blog with others who might be interested to hear from me. I will appreciate if you take time and write a comment. Thanks.<br /><br />remember, the website is <span style="font-weight:bold;">"richardhsu.net"</span>

Luckily, my co-worker and friend Gibi was getting married on Sunday and we got to attend it. His 'native place' as they like to call it here, is a small town  called Chengannur in Kerala. I stayed over night at my other co-worker Deepu's place nearby and travelled back to Kochi on his bullet the next morning. <br /><br />Took this photo while in Chengannur.<br />

<p>Friends of mine already know what I think about Kerala and its people, especially Kochi [Cochin]. Its the most beautiful place that I have ever visited. No wonder, someone came up with &quot;God's own country&quot; as a way to describe this green carpeted state. But its not only the land scape or the natural beauty that is nice about Kerala, its also the people here.</p>
<p>Keralites are mostly honest, civilised and nice people. This I state in comparison to people in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Maharashtra and a few other states that I know a little bit about. This is an entirely personal opinion [as it always is].</p>
<p>Just last night, on the train from Chennai to Ernakulam [Cochin], the air conditioning in the coach I was in was not working and there was a married couple with a sweet little daughter and the poor child couldn't tolerate the heat in the air tight AC coach. My other co-passengers were also very uneasy but then, most of the people travelling were from Kerala [most were Malayalis] and so they showed patience and acknowledged the efforts the railway folks were making to fix the AC. I didn't hear any shouting or abuse, the kind that we can expect from a people from other parts of the country, especially my home state Bengal. I look 100% Chinese [read: foreigner] and in all my stay in Cochin, in hotels, while traveling in auto rickshaws, buying things from shops, I have never come across a person who tried to cheat me or fool me given that I am not a local. Trust me, I would know if they tried it. Contrast this to Chennai, Kolkata. Mumbai and other cities where railway stations are filled with touts and crooks.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">May 25, 2005</p></small>
I was given a laptop to work on last december and since then I've been using it for work as well as for my personal communications. Its not crashed once and I've slowly got used to its slowness. Its travelled with me to many places and I've done a lot of really interesting things in it.
<br />
<br />Tomorrow, I start on a journey to return it to my employer. For good.
<br />
<br />In fact, as I write this blog, its being reset to its original state, wiping out all the programs installed, all the little settings done, all tweaked to my personal preferences and to make it work fastest.
<br />
<br />Funny that I feel a little heart burn at losing a piece of computer hardware. Words escape me and it is at moments like these that I wish I had the vocabulary and the ability to express like my friend Anita or Deepak G.

Every time I decide that I will not do any work at home, I end up working out of home. Unlike previous times, the arrangements at home for working is much better. But I am still the same, basically. So, inspite of everything working in my favour, I keep getting my priorities wrong and therefore I am still struggling to get any work done from home. Its cost me a lot financially. Still I don't seem to learn. I'll be taking a new place which is far from my present home, where [hopefully] I will be able to spend more time on work. I am taking on huge cost by moving to another place and time will tell if its justified.<br /><br />I truly envy people who manage to work for a company for years and years. They gather a lot of experience and good will. In contrast, I have an attention span of a kid. Within a year, I get bored and demotivated, start looking for something else to do technologically. I've been lucky till now, but need to correct myself quickly. Else, I'll end up being talked about 'the kid <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">had</span> a lot of potential'.

<small><p class="post-date">Mar 16, 2005</p></small>
<p>I just viewed the short documentary &quot;The Legend of Fat Mama-Stories from Calcutta's Melting 'Wok' &quot;. Its shows the Indian Chinese at Kolkata and covers our food habbits, new year celebrations and also the India-China war of 1962. Its amazing that a small and insignificant community like ours would interest people enough to be aired on BBC World. But I must point something out, in the documentary, it talks a lot of about 1962 war with China and the ill treatment to the Indian Chinese at that time.</p>
<p>To set the records straight, India is amongst one of the world's best places for anybody to live in. Inspite of the communal problems, its a place where anybody could settle and prosper without any hindrances. Of course, as its a developing country, the ills of corruption and uncivilized conduct of some people will be felt occasionally but then this applies to all Indians and not just to Indian Chinese. I have never really felt any issues arising out of the war on our generation and I am positive it didn't affect anyone of the generation before me either. As a proof, one only needs to look at the general economic condition of the Indian Chinese. I am proud to be Indian and also proud of my Chinese origins. There is no conflict or problems at all.</p>
<p>Since June 2004, I have been to Kochi[Cochin], Chennai, Bangalore, Dubai [U.A.E] and Ghana and my travels have only reconfirmed my above statements. India is a good place to be in. If people in our community are migrating, its purely because western countries offer better life style [social security, health care, less corruption etc. etc.] and not because we have been ill treated or something. We are migrating for the same reasons as Malayalis going to the Dubai or Sadarjis to Canada.</p>

I am listening to Girish Karnad read President Abdul Kalam's autobiography "Wings of Fire" which amongst other things also talks about the failures that the Indian space and missile programmes faced. He remembers fondly the naive criticisms he received while the Agni missile launch was delayed time and again due to technical reasons. Hearing him, I now realise how easily we criticize and try to frame people for their faults without thinking twice about what we are doing. What good purpose will our snide comments serve ? Are we helping, if not, then we should be supportive and keep quiet.<br /><br />From today, I will keep this in mind and hopefully hurt people lesser.

unlike last time, i had no problems with immigration, the official asked me my name, father's name, where am i going, why am in going there and then stamp, stamp and away i go, a little progress than last time around.
<br />
<br />i have gone through security check also, sitting in Sify's iWay waiting for the Emirates plane to come at approx. 4:30am. Although browing here is a little expensive at Rs. 60/hr, its ok, by paying Rs. 60/- i will be able to spend 1 hour rather than just sit and wait. i didn't carry any book also thinking that i will be in the plane and will get magazines to read.
<br />
<br />the whole flying experience is not particularly interesting, but i am going to a visit two new places and that is a little exciting.
