"Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else." -- <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26911.html">James M. Barrie</a><br /><br />This quote cannot be more apt when applied to my present situation.<br /><br />Till about 3 months back [June 2005], I never really did any work. I was employed full-time and paid by technology companies from 2000-2005 for solving problems with computers but it was never 'work'. Honestly, I didn't even realise how time flew by and I had been programming computers professionally for the last 5 years. I don't remember ever feeling like "oh shit, tomorrow's monday". I don't remember feeling relieved and happy to leave office and go home. In fact, for the last 5 years, I may have spent more than 80% of my 'awake time' doing something or the other with computers. If not programming, then reading about technology. Ocassionally, assembling computers or troubleshooting computers at friends and relatives. Everyone who knows me, know that the only thing I know about is computers and thats about the only thing I really like and can talk for hours on end about.<br /><br />Coming back to 'work'. I do work now and have been working for the past 2 months. About a month in the restaurant as waiter and now in a bank's back office doing data entry. It sounds like I am not happy with it but thats not the case. Money is the main consideration now behind my daily efforts. With programming, money was secondary and a bonus. See, the word 'daily' and 'efforts' got associated with work.<br /><br />Programming and technology is a part time hobby now. Also, I have developed an interest in photography which continues to jostle with technology for my 'free' time.<br /><br />Of course, a lazy person like me would prefer not to have to work at all. I have tried to get into technology companies but have not succeeded yet. Maybe next year, some organisation will pay me for having fun with computers again. Until then, I will work.
