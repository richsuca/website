<small><p class="post-date">Jul 05, 2019</p></small>
<p>A friend emailed me <a href="http://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html">Einstein's riddle</a>. He said it took him 25 mins to solve. That gave me a bit of motivation to give it a try. I was at my son's swimming lesson when I read the email and quickly realised that I wasn't going to beat his time. But, as I started solving it with Google Sheets on the iPhone, the idea of using database tables and Sql to generate cartesian product, followed by a process of filtering out untrue data got me intrigued.</p>
<p>It took me well over an hour but it worked and it was fun. <em>Stop</em> here and go to the riddle page linked above if you want to give it try.</p>
<p>I used a Sqlite database and below Sql to solve it.</p>

<p>With my son's help, I created tables with pen &amp; paper, filled one column with one of the possibilities, then filled the blanks using hints. When one of the hints conflicted with what we had filled in, we stopped, and repeated the process with the next one. It got faster as we went through them and the 12th row in the list turned out to be the one.</p>
<p>The hand written table looked like:</p>
<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>

<p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>
    <th>4</th>
    <th>5</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>norwegian</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>brit</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>german</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>water</td>
    <td>milk</td>
    <td>coffee</td>

  </tr>
