<p>Sep 10, 2009</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I was a guest in a restaurant named &quot;India taste&quot;. The restaurant is owned by a north Indian serving a mixture of north Indian and &quot;moghlai&quot; food (e.g. tandoori chicken). I don't think the owners targeted Chinese-Indians or Indian-Chinese but I was surprised to see all the customers there were Indian-Chinese (more than 50 of them!). Given that our community is small here (Toronto), everyone was surprised as well and there was a lot of greeting and &quot;hi&quot;/&quot;hello&quot; going on. Amazing.</p>
<p>This is yet another example that Indian-Chinese are quite special in that we incorporate all the goodness of China and India and Canada.</p>

<p>Jul 20, 2009</p>
<p>I was procrastinating on the weekend vacuum+moping+re-arrange+garbage disposal routine last weekend until a cousin of my called to say if they could come by and return my computer back. How long would it take to come? about 30 mins.</p>
<p>As if my life depended on it, I went full speed and before they reached my place (they were only a few minutes late), the foyer, living room, kitchen, my son's toy room, my computer room were all nice and clean and tidy! I don't remember seeing all the rooms this tidy in recent weeks and its quite enjoyable now thanks to visitors.</p>

<p>Jun 11, 2009</p>
When the helpful elderly salesman was writing the invoice, he asked "Is this for your son?" (Aiden was still busy running around the store with so many guitars and pianos), I said "No, for me!", "Aha" he replied. I followed with "I have waited for 30 years to learn piano, my son is lucky he will not wait that long". The salesman smiled. I handed him my credit card, he handed me the big box that had the digital piano inside along with a smaller one for the stand and adapter in a plastic bag and that concluded the transaction. Now, I can practice piano at home! :-)
<hr /><h3><a href="/2009/05/28/fatherhood">Growing Up as a Father</a></h3>
<p>May 28, 2009</p>
<p>One constant exercise I have to go through is changing the balance between what I will allow my son to do and what I will not. I want him to learn things by figuring it out himself but also protect him (and others).</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<p>1) Don't let him play with Styrofoam: He will enjoy it but I will not (enjoy cleaning up after). I was assembling a coffee table and asked Aiden to help me remove the packaging and put them back in the box, which he did very happily. While I was busy fitting the legs, within minutes he had broken up the Styrofoam in pieces and it was all over the floor. Grrrhh!. Its not easy cleaning it up using a vacuum either because it breaks up into very little pieces which are light and sticks to things(including your fingers).</p>
<p>2) Don't let him play around things that are unstable, like a bicycle. While we were waiting for our ferry at Pelee Island dock, I decided to rent a bicycle with a kid's trailer at the back but did ride too long as I went too fast and scared Aiden :( . So I put the bicycle on its stand and was talking to my wife Caroline while Aiden we busy inspecting the cycle. He did something that caused the trailer to detach which hurt his thumb very bad. His thumb nail almost came off! Its much better now but that was a scary experience for me and a painful one for my son.</p>

<p>Apr 20, 2009</p>
<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_j4-Ptxs4ZpE/Se0tphgD6pI/AAAAAAAACa8/_fnu98YwK38/StPaul-Montreal.jpg" alt="View from St Paul Hotel" />
<p>This is my 4th visit to stylish city of Montreal, Quebec in less than a year. My liking for the city keeps increasing with every visit. The buildings, the people, the language, there is something in it that makes me want to spend more time here.</p>
<p>What did I eat? Philly Cheese Steak medium sized pizza. The guy who took my order turned out to be from Bangldesh and, as has happened a lot, he is surprised to know that I am from India and can speak bengali!</p>
<p>We had a good conversation in bengali mostly about me and what I was doing in Montreal. I asked him if he knew a good bangladeshi restaurant closeby and he introduced me to Maharaja at the intersection of &quot;Rue Guy&quot; and &quot;Rene Levesque Boulevard&quot;. Will try that out for dinner tomorrow as I have not had Bangadeshi/Bengali food for a while now.</p>
<p>The medium pizza was tasty but more than I could eat. I went though the first two slices nicely but ate only the steak parts of the rest of the slices, regrettably wasting a lot. Even though I did not consume it all, my stomach now feels heavy and over expanded after a glass of water.</p>
<p>The hotel I am staying at(3rd time now) is &quot;St. Paul&quot;. Compared to the other hotels I have had the privilege of staying at, this one is the best in terms of its stlying. Its also the cheapest. When you enter your room, you will hear classiical music playing on the radio and the overall lighting and design and layout of things is perfect.</p>
<p>While I cannot wait to be back at home in Toronto, this week should go well in Montreal.</p>
<hr /><h3><a href="/2009/03/10/gadget-wishlist">Gadget Wishlist</a></h3>
<p>Mar 10, 2009</p>
<p>I have been eyeing a few things for a while now, first a Digital SLR and now a Music System. I did buy the camera(<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm" title="Nikon D40">Nikon D40</a>) but returned it unused. The price dropped to $429 at Blacks and I just could not resist it. The thought of that amount in my credit card bill was enough to make me pack it again and head back to the store to return it. Its still in my mind(especially now that Nikon has an &quot;affordable&quot; <a href="http://nikon.ca/en/Product.aspx?m=14310&amp;disp=Overview" title="Fast DX Lens">35/1.8</a> for DSLRs)</p>
<p>The other thing that I have recently started wishing is a surround audio system to go with the 46&quot; LCD. There was a good deal at Futureshop last Saturday(Polk Audio RM6880 5.1 speakers + Yamaha 6130 receiver for $499.99) which ran out of stock by the time I called to check. Just as well, as I realised later that the small surround speakers will work well for movies but it might not satisfy me for music hearing(listening to FM radio is a regular source of my entertainment). So I will probably buy a pair of bookshelf speakers to start with and add more later to complete the surround sound system. Lets hope I get a sizable refund when I do my taxes next week.</p>
<p>The above two are the ones that I have thought the most about, but they are not the only gadgets in my list. There is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/imac/" title="Apple iMac">Apple iMac</a> which I hope to buy in 2-3 years from now when my current desktop will become ancient and I will finally switch out of Windows. I have been thinking about a NAS device recently as my current storage reaches 90% usage levels.</p>
<p>Ah. Too much desires but not enough $$$ to satisfy them yet. I will wait.</p>

<hr /><h3><a href="/2009/03/03/seeing-my-son-leave">Seeing My Son Leave</a></h3>
<p>Mar 03, 2009</p>
Seeing my son go to the babysitter is painfull. He is weeks shy of 2 years, but knows that he has to go, and does not complain, but you can see it in his face(expression of resignation) and his good bye is very soft and has a tone of sadness. The babysitter loves him and takes very good care of him and I am sure when he does reach his home, he is his normal active-happy self.
