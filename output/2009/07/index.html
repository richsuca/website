<p>We were watching &quot;King of Queens&quot; where Doug and Carrie were comparing a list of 20 things they each liked to see what they have in common. Caroline and I played that game as well and here is my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Beach</li>
<li>Rain</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Walking</li>
</ol>

<p>Jul 20, 2009</p>
<p>I was procrastinating on the weekend vacuum+moping+re-arrange+garbage disposal routine last weekend until a cousin of my called to say if they could come by and return my computer back. How long would it take to come? about 30 mins.</p>
<p>As if my life depended on it, I went full speed and before they reached my place (they were only a few minutes late), the foyer, living room, kitchen, my son's toy room, my computer room were all nice and clean and tidy! I don't remember seeing all the rooms this tidy in recent weeks and its quite enjoyable now thanks to visitors.</p>
