<p>Sep 10, 2009</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I was a guest in a restaurant named &quot;India taste&quot;. The restaurant is owned by a north Indian serving a mixture of north Indian and &quot;moghlai&quot; food (e.g. tandoori chicken). I don't think the owners targeted Chinese-Indians or Indian-Chinese but I was surprised to see all the customers there were Indian-Chinese (more than 50 of them!). Given that our community is small here (Toronto), everyone was surprised as well and there was a lot of greeting and &quot;hi&quot;/&quot;hello&quot; going on. Amazing.</p>
<p>This is yet another example that Indian-Chinese are quite special in that we incorporate all the goodness of China and India and Canada.</p>
