<small><p>Feb 28, 2014</p></small>
<p>Sybase's processing of a where clause in a derived table confused me. Instead of applying it first, it seemed to move the where clause outside of the derived table. To recreate the behaviour, here is a table with two rows:</p>
<pre><code>create table data(nums varchar(4))
insert into data values('255')
insert into data values('3000')

select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu
from data
where len(nums) &amp;lt; 4 -- filter out 3000
) inside
where nu = 255
</code></pre>

<p>What I expect: 255</p>
<p>What happens:
Query throws Arithmetic overflow error during conversion of '3000' to tinyint(range is 0-255). I expected the filter in the derived table to be applied first eliminating '3000' from getting converted but that is not the case. It seems Sybase does below instead:</p>
<pre><code>select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu, nums
from data
) inside
where nu = 255
and len(nums) &amp;lt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>I could not find out why so this remains a mystery but what makes it more interesting is below works fine:</p>
<pre><code>select nu
from
( select convert(tinyint, nums) nu
from data
where nums != '3000'
) inside
where nu = 255
</code></pre>

<p>We used a temporary table to ensure filter happens.</p>

<small><p>Feb 21, 2014</p></small>
<p>Linux <code>find</code> command ignores*¬†‚Äìname (dash name) option and runs finding all files instead of exiting with an unknown parameter error.</p>
<p>Wrong command (with dash name option):
<code>find ‚Äìname '*.dat' -exec rm {} \;</code></p>
<p>What I wanted it to do: Find all files matching *.dat wildcard and delete them
What it does: Find all files in the directory and delete them, then throw an error message it could not find *.dat file or directory</p>
<p>Correct command (with hyphen name option):
<code>find -name '*.dat' -exec rm {} \;</code></p>
<p>I was typing the command in Outlook and the AutoCorrect feature changed - (hyphen) to¬†‚Äì (dash). It was copy-pasted from the email to a Putty session executed causing undesired behaviour.</p>
<p>How to avoid this?</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Turn off AutoCorrect" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/word-help/undo-or-turn-off-automatic-formatting-HA102491299.aspx?CTT=1">Turn off AutoCorrect &amp; AutoFormat options in Outlook</a></li>
<li>Start with a Plain Text formatted email</li>
<li>Write the commands in Notepad or Notepad++ and attach the text file to the email</li>
</ul>
<p>*It does not really ignore it, rather, it interprets it as a verbatim file name you want to find instead of wild card search.</p>

<small><p>Feb 13, 2014</p></small>
<p>Many websites are promoting learning to code/program a computer and strangely several politicians have said they will learn it and encourage the public to learn it as well.</p>
<p>Coding/programming is <em>not</em> for the general public just like diagnosing an illness or defending a case in the court or fixing a car engine. Just because we use computers and the internet a lot does not mean we need to learn how computer programs are made. Learning to avoid computer virus, theft or misuse of their data is for the general public but not coding.</p>
<p>http://politicalscrapbook.net/2014/02/tory-boss-of-government-coding-education-initiative-cant-code-lottie-dexter/</p>
<p>Above links to an article about the Director of UK government's &quot;Year of Code&quot; initiative. She does not know how to code herself, she says things like &quot;code is an international language&quot;, &quot;I think you can pick it up in a day&quot; to show her ignorance.</p>
<p>Politicians or politically connected getting a job they know nothing about is old news but this topic is close to me so wanted to share my thoughts.</p>
<p>Will I teach my kids how to code/program computer? Maybe. If they have an interest and if it is part of their school curriculum but not because they need it or they will get a good job or make a lot of money.</p>
<p>What I would force them to learn? cooking, swimming, doing nothing and being bored ;-)</p>
