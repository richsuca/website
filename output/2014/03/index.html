<small><p class="post-date">Mar 15, 2014</p></small>
<p>A friend‚Äôs Acer laptop was slow and she asked me to look into it. The approach I took is similar to the one for <a title="Asus laptop cleanup" href="https://richardhsu.net/2012/01/10/removing-useless-preloaded-applications-from-asus-laptop/">Asus</a> but since this was Acer, I had to do research on Acer specific ‚Äòbloatware‚Äô/‚Äòcrapware‚Äô.</p>
<p>Microsoft sells computers with the ‚Äú<a title="Microsoft Signature Experience" href="https://signature.microsoft.com">Signature Experience</a>&quot; that comes without any ‚Äòbloatware‚Äô/‚Äòcrapware‚Äô (what they call 'junk ware'/'trialware'). If you are buying a new Windows computer, I recommend <a title="Microsoft Store" href="http://content.microsoftstore.com/en-us/Home.aspx">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a partial summary of work done to get Windows 7 working responsively again.</p>
<h4>Work done</h4>
<ol>
<li>Reset Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Reset Google Chrome</li>
<li>Make Google Chrome default</li>
<li>Setup Power button to Hibernate instead of Shutdown (to reduce startup time)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Removed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Acer Backup Manager</li>
<li>Bing Bar</li>
<li>Rogers Online Protection (subscription service)</li>
<li>Rogers Servicepoint Agent</li>
<li>Norton Online Backup</li>
<li>MyWinLocker Suite</li>
<li>Acer Registration</li>
<li>eBay</li>
</ul>
<p>Installed:<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials &amp; run a Quick scan.</p>
<p>Finally, I reviewed logs and investigated and resolved the errors. One of these was a DHCP error which was causing the Wireless connections at startup to run very slow. I disabled the unused Intel Wireless Display network components and this was resolved.</p>
<p>What I started but could not complete:<br />
<a title="Spinrite" href="https://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm">Spinrite</a> maintenance (would have taken days to scan 700GB)</p>
<p>What I should have done but missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <a title="MSRT" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx">Malicious Software Removal Tool</a> <strong>first thing</strong></li>
<li>Run <a title="Secunia PSI" href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/">Secunia PSI</a> to find out if all programs are updated or not.</li>
</ul>

<small><p class="post-date">Mar 10, 2014</p></small>
<p>Eight years ago, I subscribed to daily Toronto Star newspaper. I still remember that evening... A lady with a small table full of Toronto Star newspapers greeted us at the lobby of the apartment. She offered $1/week subscription plus a gift and I was sold. I got a chess set (pieces were plastic but looked like glass) and years of great news, opinions, knowledge and recommendations. I enjoyed reading Toronto Star and still do.</p>
<p>There were phases where I would read a lot of it daily, and then there were also weeks it went unread. For over a year now, since I got the iPad, the paper goes straight into the recycle bin more than to the breakfast table or the bathroom (my favourite reading place). Many times, I have considered cancelling it but changed my mind. I still read Toronto Star, but more using the computer or iPad.</p>
<p>The reading experience on computer or iPad is not as good as the printed version but the amount of unread paper I put into the recycle bin makes me feel guilty. So this week, I finally cancelled the subscription to the Toronto Star newspaper. Instead, I opted for monthly Digital Access subscription that gives full access to thestar.com including a Replica Edition (digital version of the newspaper).</p>
<p>I am buying or borrowing eBooks more than paper versions as well. There is a practical convenience to digital reading but I cannot help but feel sad about the trend away from printed paper. This feels more like a good bye to an old friend than anything else.</p>
