<p>Mar 10, 2014</p>
<p>Eight years ago, I subscribed to daily Toronto Star newspaper. I still remember that evening... A lady with a small table full of Toronto Star newspapers greeted us at the lobby of the apartment. She offered $1/week subscription plus a gift and I was sold. I got a chess set (pieces were plastic but looked like glass) and years of great news, opinions, knowledge and recommendations. I enjoyed reading Toronto Star and still do.</p>
<p>There were phases where I would read a lot of it daily, and then there were also weeks it went unread. For over a year now, since I got the iPad, the paper goes straight into the recycle bin more than to the breakfast table or the bathroom (my favourite reading place). Many times, I have considered cancelling it but changed my mind. I still read Toronto Star, but more using the computer or iPad.</p>
<p>The reading experience on computer or iPad is not as good as the printed version but the amount of unread paper I put into the recycle bin makes me feel guilty. So this week, I finally cancelled the subscription to the Toronto Star newspaper. Instead, I opted for monthly Digital Access subscription that gives full access to thestar.com including a Replica Edition (digital version of the newspaper).</p>
<p>I am buying or borrowing eBooks more than paper versions as well. There is a practical convenience to digital reading but I cannot help but feel sad about the trend away from printed paper. This feels more like a good bye to an old friend than anything else.</p>
