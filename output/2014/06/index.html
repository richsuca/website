<small><p class="post-date">Jun 20, 2014</p></small>
<p>On the way to my son's soccer practise this morning, I heard about the ugly side of soccer (or football) on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/essays/2014/06/15/fifa-football-frenzy-unmasked/" title="FIFA Football Frenzy, Unmasked">cbc Radio One</a>. Stories about a referee stabbing an arguing player to death, then himself getting beheaded by outraged fans in a Brazilian town a year ago, 21 people killed in riots after a playoff loss in Democratic Republic of Congo last month, gunfights at a Buenos Aires stadium and 'plentiful and growing' corruption charges against FIFA.</p>
<blockquote>
  It is ironic that such a boring athletic contest
  could lead to such violence and fanatical behaviour
</blockquote>
<p>Said the host of the radio show making the case for soccer not being '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Game" title="The Beautiful Game">beautiful</a>' anymore.</p>
<p>Having played soccer in my school years and followed the European leagues and World Cups, I don't agree the game is boring to watch or play but I agree it is not worth the violence. Soccer games, as with anything else, can be an excuse for violence or money making.</p>
<p>At my son's soccer practise where kids between 6 to 12 years old play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal" title="Futsal">indoors</a>, what I saw was 'beautiful'. The shouting of &quot;give it to me!&quot;, &quot;oooh&quot;, &quot;aaah&quot;, the goal celebrations, the funny misses that gets everyone laughing, the drama (a kid was celebrating his sister's goal against his team!) expressed the fun, passion and excitement of playing the game for its own sake. It was just as entertaining as the games on TV.</p>
<p>Even in a small group of kids, I saw unique styles. There is a spectacled boy who shoots with great power. I volunteered for goalie last Sunday and dreaded the sight of him with the ball and an open shot at me. Another boy (bigger than the rest) plays like a bulldozer, he moves slow but no one can stop him and he spends large durations in the sidelines resting. The best player is the coach's protege. He is an all round player: controls the ball well, passes well and shoots with precision. I did not see him play for 2 days and missed it like a fan. The boys and girls play hard and argue just like men do but they laugh and fool around too unlike televised competition games. I have my <a href="http://richardhsu.net/2014/05/19/e-ink/" title="Kobo eReader">Kobo eReader</a> or a book with me at soccer practise but only read it when the kids are doing exercises. As soon as the games begin, my attention shifts to it and I cannot help myself but get involved. I shout &quot;shoot&quot;, applause when a goal is scored and make funny facial expressions when there is a near miss.</p>
<p>My son plays defence with no interest in scoring or shooting at goal but he scored one today and I saw him smile with pride and joy as his team mates hi-fived him and patted him on his back.</p>
<p>Ah yes, the beautiful game.</p>

<hr /><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/06/06/seglaro-or-karlso/">SEGLAR√ñ or KARLS√ñ</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">Jun 06, 2014</p></small>
<p>Which Ikea umbrella is better for the backyard? <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70260320/">SEGLAR√ñ</a> or <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10260295/">KARLS√ñ</a> ?</p>
<p>A month ago, the wife and I started looking for outdoor furniture and umbrella for the backyard. Ikea (our favourite) was the first place we went shopping. At Ikea, they had this nice demo area with all the umbrellas and furnitures on display and our attention went to the big rectangular hanging umbrella called SEGLAR√ñ and the dark brown acacia wood <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/14213/">√ÑPPLAR√ñ</a> sofa set underneath. I could imagine myself relaxing in the backyard sitting in the sofa shaded by the umbrella.</p>
<p>There was some hesitation about the sofa so we wanted to check other stores but the three member shopping team (wife, mother-in-law and I) were in agreement to buy the SEGLAR√ñ umbrella as it had the design (cantilever) and size (~11' X 8') we wanted and the price ($189) was within expectations (why we like Ikea). Since we had the whole family at the time, I did not think the umbrella would fit in the car, so decided to return another time for it.</p>
<p>I talked about the umbrella with my neighbour and he liked it too so we had planned to go to Ikea together. Weeks past but we didn't. Others did and SEGLAR√ñ umbrellas sold out across Canada! <sup id="fnref-679-1"><a href="#fn-679-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Both of us got earfuls from our respective wives for our procrastination. I blamed him and the continuous rain and he blamed me and we both attempted to make it look like we had all the intentions but nature and miscommunication was the reason we missed the 'perfect' umbrella.</p>
<p>After visiting many stores over weeks, we went back to Ikea and bought the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/14213/">√ÑPPLAR√ñ</a> sofa set and <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10260295/">KARLS√ñ</a> umbrella. KARLS√ñ is also a cantilevered/hanging umbrella but different from <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70260320/">SEGLAR√ñ</a>.</p>
<p>Comparison of the two umbrellas:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th></th><th>Shape</th><th>Coverage</th><th>Pole</th><th>Price</th><th>Turn</th><th>Tilt</th></tr>
<tr><th>SEGLAR√ñ</th>
<td>Rectangle</td><td>85 sq ft</td><td>Aluminum</td><td>C$ 189</td><td>Yes (360 &deg;)</td><td>Yes</td></th>
</tr>
<tr><th>KARLS√ñ</th>
<td>Circle</td><td>76 sq ft</td><td>Steel</td><td>C$ 89</td><td>No</td><td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Why pay $100 more for SEGLAR√ñ?</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be turned (360 &deg;) to shade different areas. <sup id="fnref-679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Tilt function; provides protection from the sun all day long. <sup id="fnref2:679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>The pole is made of aluminium so it won‚Äôt rust. <sup id="fnref3:679-2"><a href="#fn-679-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>9 sq ft more coverage (enough for a chair)</li>
<li>Rectangle is better than circle as the seating arrangements tend to be rectangular.</li>
<li>Better build quality overall</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparison of size:</p>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/219644/14115840168_6d8bb93b8f_o.png" alt="Alt" title="Compare" />
<p>This is a view from the top of the two umbrellas (SEGLAR√ñ is the rectangle, KARLS√ñ the round one). I have put three 2' X 2' chairs to show what would fit in the non-overlapping areas. SEGLAR√ñ covers a little more but not by as much as we had expected (based on our visual estimates).</p>
<p>If both were available, I would have bought SEGLAR√ñ for the features but KARLS√ñ delivers better value. Two KARLS√ñs would still cost lesser than one SEGLAR√ñ and cover about twice the area. I did buy two but one is adequate for the √ÑPPLAR√ñ seating we have. I wish it moved easily like SEGLAR√ñ to shade the entire seating area (the shade moves with the sun) but the $100 saved comforts me.</p>
