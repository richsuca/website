<p>Kids. I often look at others who have grown up kids and wonder when will mine grow up so they are not as dependent on me as they are now. As with anything, I am only looking at the half glass full. The idea that I can leave them behind at home by themselves or they can go to other places by themselves seem very appealing. Think about all the freedom and time I will have!</p>
<p>But I am often also told that the age my kids are in is the best by parents with teenage or older kids. I still remember a fellow passenger telling me that he still remembers one summer day he spent with his daugher who was 2-3 years at the time (his daughter goes to university now). As he was telling me, I can see him get lost in nostalgia reliving that day for a little bit in his mind. He was all smiles and happy and I can see he would not mind going back to that time at all.</p>
<p>I am there now.</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Jan 07, 2014</p></small>
<p>It is unfortunate that Rob Ford could be relected Mayor of Toronto in the Oct'14 elections.</p>
<h3>Why is it unfortunate?</h3>
<p>Would I trust him with decisions for the City of Toronto when he has demonstrated publicly his inability to filter out nonsense and lies?</p>
<p>The Mayor or Toronto is expected to lead counsillors, city staff and the people of the city in general but the way he handled Toronto Star's report on the video showing him smoking what appears to be crack(which he admitted after Police found the video) and subsequent embarrasements followed by (see References below) does not give me confidence that he will do a good job.</p>
<h3>If not Rob Ford, then who?</h3>
<p>Election day is 10 months away but if I had to vote today, I would vote for Karen Stintz because she is the only one among the declared candidates that I know of and it is more &quot;No Rob Ford&quot; than &quot;Yes Karen Stintz&quot; that is driving my thinking.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: If we don't have a popular single alternative to Rob Ford, then the &quot;No Rob Ford&quot; votes would split and he could end up with the most votes and get re-elected. That would be sad.</p>
<p>So, in the next 10 months leading to election day, I intend to educate myself about the candidates that are up for Mayor and a) make up my mind about who I will vote for and b) pass on information to others and help them make up their minds.</p>
