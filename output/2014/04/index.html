<p>Dec 22, 2013 (midnight)</p>
<p>For all day today, we did not have electricity at home due to power outage caused by icy weather conditions. It was a unique experience for us, having long forgotten what it is like not to have electricity and all that it enables.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had gas so we could have breakfast and coffee to start the day but soon after that, we headed out to the mall where we expected all things under one roof. Electricity, food, shopping and generally suited for passing hours of our day till, what we hoped for, the evening when power would get restored at home.</p>
<p>As it was a wide spread power outage in the city, we soon learned that it would take as long as 72 hours for power to get restored to over 250,000 houses that lost power in Toronto. We also heard of the possibility of emergency being called if things got worse (not sure what it means though).</p>
<p>Tired from sitting and doing nothing in the mall, we decided to get back home. To our pleasant surprise, the temperature inside was a liveable 16 degrees Celsius while it was about 2 degrees outside. The rest of the evening was spent with the pleasure of the company of our friendly neighbours and candle light dinner.</p>
<p>As I write this, I hear a generator running outside but see all dark. It has been fun experiencing a day without power but I look forward to going back to the normal (miss the TV and Internet already).</p>

<small><p class="post-date">Apr 05, 2014</p></small>
<p>Few weeks ago, I was walking around in downtown Tlaquepaque(Mexico) with Enrique and SJ. Outdoor weather was good, there were many others walking around and enjoying the evening. We walked past a coffee shop that had a lady singer and two guys on guitars performing outside. At first, my attention went to the singer who was singing an english song without any microphone. Her voice was powerful and you could hear it clearly 50 steps away. She finished her song and was taking a break, we continued walking and then I heard the guy on electric guitar play the SpongeBob squarepants <a title="SpongeBob squarepants background tune" href="http://youtu.be/-FlzPSbvY14">background tune</a>. I recognised it right away, turned around and noticed the guitar player smiling while he was playing it. He was having fun and I had a smile too thanks to him. My young friends walking with me did not recognise it (they don‚Äôt have kids yet) so I educated them about SpongeBob.</p>
<p>At this point, what I should have done is walked back to the guitar player and let him know that I got it, that what he did just now meant something to me, it made me smile, it made me think of my kids (especially my son who watched a lot of SpongeBob), that the already nice evening I was having got nicer because of it‚Ä¶ but I kept on walking on. Very un-cool of me.</p>
