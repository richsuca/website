How true.
<br />
<br />My wife left for Kolkata about an hour back, we had a great time this past two weeks. We went to Trivandrum, Kanyakumari, around Kochi/Cochin and visited a colleague's house in Vypeen island near Kochi, a lot of traveling and fun. From a personal perspective, we also spent a lot of time together. It was just a few months back that I left Kolkata, then we started planning her visit here and the next thing I know is she is here.
<br />
<br />Now she is sitting in AS1 of Allepey-Chennai train, sad and pondering about the future while I am here, back in my office-cum-residence, alone and keying away. Its painful and for a few moments I thought about the decision I have taken, to work away from home, away from family, friends, and last but not least, away from Caroline. The good thing is, we are agreed upon her settling closer to me, probably in Bangalore, or here in Kochi. Lets see how it pans out.
<br />
<br />My heart is heavy and a little sad, but I am happy that we had a lot of fun. I look forward to tomorrow, a brand new day, full of hope and freshness. I'll not talk anymore about the sad part, rather I am happy for all the good times we had, looking forward to the fun in store for me at work and her settling down closer to me soon.
<br />
<br />Life is beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes happy..
