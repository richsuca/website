<h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2004/12/30/my-first-real-experience-with-a-laptop/">My First Real Experience With a Laptop</a></h2>
<small><p class="post-date">Dec 30, 2004</p></small>
Since yesterday evening, I've been working on a laptop as my primary computer. I've used laptops before but never had one which was dedicated to me. The fun thing is that its also my first real Windows XP experience. Its now configured for email, both official and personal [runs both Outlook and Thunderbird] and my elaborate development tools is also setup and running.
<br />
<br />At first I found it annoying [described later] but soon got used to it. The upside with this [and indeed most] laptop is the display: its flat and is not CRT based [<strong>C</strong>athode <strong>R</strong>ay <strong>T</strong>ube, the kind we have in most TVs today]. Rather its based on what I believe to be some sort of LCD technology [<strong>L</strong>iquid <strong>C</strong>rystal <strong>D</strong>isplay, the kind we have in calculators]. Also, the brightness and contrast is very smooth on the eyes. With <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx">ClearType</a> feature enabled, the text is really easy to read and looks nice.
<br />
<br />The downside is the performance and compactness [the keys on the keyboard are laid out differently, making it difficult to type fast [I have to keep looking at the keyboard now, but I am getting better :-)]. I am used to having a few nifty utilities like <a href="http://wordweb.info/free/">WordWeb</a> etc. open all the time, but I can't afford that now. Oh, and before I forget, the surface of the laptop is hot [no pun intended]. Especially on the left bottom edge of the keyboard. That area is in direct contact with the 'under-side' of my left wrist and its not pleasant at all.
<br />
<br />Thus far I have only this much to report [there is more, but I would then be completely twisting this personal blog entry around a technical axle. Its bent enough already :-)]

<p>Following is an extract from <a href="https://richardhsu.net/2004/10/26/the-joy-of-reading-stories/">&quot;The Young Explorer&quot; by Horatio Alger</a> :-</p>
<p>In this part, a group of american gold miners are bullying and questioning a Mongolian [generalised by the author as a Chinaman]. The funny part is about the way a Mongolian [and indeed a Chinese] speaks english.</p>
<p>Irish-American : &quot;...Where do you come from?&quot;</p>
<p>Mongolian [named Ki Sing] : &quot;Me come from 'Flisco.&quot; [Its suppose to be 'f<span style="font-weight:bold;">r</span>isco', short for San Francisco]</p>
<p>It is well known that a Chinaman cannot pronounce the letter r,</p>
<p>which in his mouth softens to l, in some cases producing a ludicrous effect.</p>
<p>&quot;What have you come here for, Cy King, or whatever your name is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name Ki Sing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's a haythen name; anyhow,&quot; remarked Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I'd have such a name, I'd go widout one intirely. Did you</p>
<p>hear the gintleman ask you what you came here for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bling me,&quot; answered Ki Sing shrewdly.</p>
<p>There was another laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chinee ain't no fool!&quot; said Dick Roberts.</p>
<p>&quot;What made you leave China?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Me come to Amelica fol gold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, ho! That's it, is it? What are you going to do with your gold</p>
<p>when you find it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cally it back to China.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And when you've callied it back, what'll you do then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me mally wife, have good time and plenty money to buy lice.&quot;</p>

Was in Kolkata yesterday, am in Chennai today, sort of stranded as I am headed for Kochi, but, again its Holiday season, so tickets are <u>extremely</u> difficult to get. No buses running till after Christmas, have asked an agent to try for a train ticket, if I am lucky, I'll hopping on the train at around 2am [a few hours from now].
<br />
<br />In short, have been travelling way too much lately, not sure where I will be. Everything has been very uncertain since June this year. I hate to pack and unpack and watch people say 'bye'. Don't like it at all. Yet, I have opted for it.
<br />
<br />Hope I have better options next year. Oh Santa!! You know what will be written in the little piece of paper under my pillow on Christmas eve.

<small><p class="post-date">Dec 07, 2004</p></small>
6 digits weigh heavily on me. never imagined that i would have six digits on the left column. although irrelevant now, i still find myself wondering if its all worth it ? things like this touch on the core and base of our thinking, our reasons, of course the reason still stands, so i continue on this unknown path, its almost a gamble, yet i find myself optimistic. God only knows what mental torment i go through at times, knowing that i have worked very hard for what i have today, the opportunities, recognition, reputation, all of which i am trading for an unknown, extremely expensive venture.
<br />
<br />there is a word in Hindi - "Aukaat", i am trying things way beyond my "Aukaat", this is something i have never done before, all my life, its always been about staying true to my standing. Yet, now i have 6 digits. My staying still since my birthday this year has only added to the weight. Its like burning a candle from one side and not adding wax at the other side, worse now and then, i do burn it from the other side as well!!
<br />
<br />I pray to God to keep me smiling whatever happens. :-)

<small><p class="post-date">Dec 01, 2004</p></small>
My gradmother is old. She is ~80 years of age and have been completely bed ridden for the last few years. For me, my grandma has played the typical grand mother's role. She would buy things for me, feed me, beat me, make me do chores, helped me get my first computer and paid for my Microsoft certification course. In short, a lot of what I am today is because of her. It would be dishonest to say that she is all nice but i don't want to remember her for the 'not-nice' things.<br /><br />There was a time that I totally distanced myself from her and became cold to her. She could speak properly then, she could sit up and was much better than the state she is in now. But I ignored her and also hated her at times [my reasons are irrelevant now]. Now, I regret and want that time to come back so I could spend more time with her. It pains me to see her in her current state, she is begging me to bite her vein so she could die. She refuses to take medicine or food and my mum has to force it down her throat so she could be 'alive'. She had a  minor stroke and as a result her left eye doesn't open now. Its always shut. Her right eye opens but due to the tears and contant lying down, its watery all the time. Everytime I look at her and hear her moan, it tells me one thing, she doesn't want to be 'alive' anymore, she wants to be relieved of the physical and mental pain. Its just a matter of time before she'll finally decide not to fight anymore and give up. She repeatedly expresses her desire to die as if someone in thirst is asking for water. There are many other very disturbing things that she does in desparation, things which any [normally] hyper active person would do in the state that she is in.<br /><br />All her life, she has always been in control of things, to a certain extent been in control of things in every family members life. She is a self dependent, hard working type and for a person like that to be completely bed ridden, weak from a recent surgery is hell.<br /><br />It has been a truly humbling experience [i was away from home for the last few months]. Looking at her, the meaning of life and living takes on an altogether different meaning. We shouldn't take health or life for granted. Certainly we should not take the people around us for granted, be it spouse, parents, brothers, sisters or relatives and friends [no particular order intened]. So now i always think of each moment as being special and precious and automatically things look better, happier. I am happy and thank God for giving me a chance to be nice to my Grandma but at the same time I can't help but pray to God to relieve her of her pain and suffering.

<small><p class="post-date">Nov 06, 2004</p></small>
Just a few hours more and I'll be on my way back home, back to Kolkata. Last time I left, I had no idea I would come back to this beautiful city, yet when I arrived I had no idea I would be leaving it so soon, indeed it has be short but with lots of memories. My heart is a little heavy right now. Don't know where the train of life will take me.
<br />
<br />I maybe returning soon, or maybe not for a long long time. Either way, it will not be the same.
<br />
<br />Bijus just reached India today and before leaving for his home town, he gave me a farewell hug, both of us have a lot of things to say, we had a lot of plans for our company, it seems I'll not be playing my part fully this time. I could sense a little sadness in him as he could in me, he has been a great friend,  still, my only mentor, still, the only manager I am totally happy with. I wish I could have done more. I disappoint him and our company in many ways, yet I have no option.
<br />
<br />The security fellow Ramesh will drop to the station and help me get my luggage on the train. He has been a great help to me. Although we hardly understand each other's language, we have been able to communicate.
<br />
<br />I must also mention my colleagues Bert Thomas and Deepu Sreedhar, they have also helped me feel at home.

I am subscribed to <a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/">WordSmith's A Word A Day</a> and today's word was <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/horatio_alger.html">Horatio Alger</a>. That's not the reason for this post, the interesting part is that the mail had a <a href="http://gutenberg.org/author/Horatio+Alger">link</a> to an eBook which had Horatio Alger's stories. I don't know exactly what made me go to the next page and download the <a href="http://gutenberg.org/etext/5623">"The Young Explorer"</a>. So far, I've read only the first chapter and its so much fun. Its a book a child can read. Simple and very interesting, reminds me of my young self. :-)
<br />
<br />Here is something I find the most interesting in chapter 1: Ben, a boy of 16 says to his Uncle "I want to go to California."
<br />
<br />I am curious and excited about what young Ben will do in California, how he'll survive alone, the people he'll meet and the trials &amp; tribulations that he'll go through to find his fortune.
<br />
<br />I am child at heart and there's a smile on my face, just like a child who has got a new toy to play with.

<small><p class="post-date">Oct 23, 2004</p></small>
There are two non-tech blogs that I read often. One of them is by my friend Anita and another by Deepak Gulati, a Microsoft guy that I interacted with over email. Both of their blogs have one thing that draws me to them. You read things totally original. You read something which is very personal. Well, this blog of mine is also original &amp; personal, but it is written in very simple [dry] english and there is nothing poetic. They have a natural gift for poetry, art and they are more sensitive than me. Anita's blog has more poetry while Deepak's has a lot of photos coupled with his detailed descriptions of his observations [he sort of operates at a very very low level in english language, he uses a lot of big words, the kind I get every day from 'A Word A Day'].
<br />
<br />I am sure, their writings have influenced me in some manner small or big. I am not linking their blogs here cause I don't know if they would want me to.
<br />
<br />Its been very enjoyable [brings some life into my geek world] so far and I pray that their pens [err. their keystrokes] keeps flowing [err. {no equivalent description for flowing}]. :-)

I was creating nero disc images of the three VCDs of my wedding today, when I opened the second CD to view it. It brought back memories, happy ones, of my wedding day. That part was showing us about to start serving tea to everyone young and old.. forwarded it a little bit and it reached a point where we were asked to kiss and were posing for the photographer, then there was this huge demand for me to carry her. :-)
<br />
<br />My heart gives a million thanks to Michael Huang, a friend who volunteered to video our wedding with his personal video camera for free. We had [stupidly] thought of cutting cost and not opting for a professional video guy. If Michael had not done it, I wouldn't have any today. On hind sight, we should have had Peter Shu [an excellent pro and friend's dad] video our wedding also. I think I asked him only two days before, he was already booked for that day :-( [stupid me]. Anyways, Michael was God sent [God has always covered for my stupidity] and he did a decent job of it.
<br />
<br />So many friends, relatives, neighbours etc. were present and it was so nice of everyone to have come and attended. I realised how ugly and stupid I look [thank God, Caroline liked/ignored my face]. It was an all happy occassion for everyone. I can't believe I went through all that with Caroline and me at the centre of it all. I am a shy person and now when I think about it, I managed ok.
<br />
<br />Its nearing 2 years now..  we're getting along, working things out.

How true.
<br />
<br />My wife left for Kolkata about an hour back, we had a great time this past two weeks. We went to Trivandrum, Kanyakumari, around Kochi/Cochin and visited a colleague's house in Vypeen island near Kochi, a lot of traveling and fun. From a personal perspective, we also spent a lot of time together. It was just a few months back that I left Kolkata, then we started planning her visit here and the next thing I know is she is here.
<br />
<br />Now she is sitting in AS1 of Allepey-Chennai train, sad and pondering about the future while I am here, back in my office-cum-residence, alone and keying away. Its painful and for a few moments I thought about the decision I have taken, to work away from home, away from family, friends, and last but not least, away from Caroline. The good thing is, we are agreed upon her settling closer to me, probably in Bangalore, or here in Kochi. Lets see how it pans out.
<br />
<br />My heart is heavy and a little sad, but I am happy that we had a lot of fun. I look forward to tomorrow, a brand new day, full of hope and freshness. I'll not talk anymore about the sad part, rather I am happy for all the good times we had, looking forward to the fun in store for me at work and her settling down closer to me soon.
<br />
<br />Life is beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes happy..

<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7b8dc7cd-033a-4cb8-ba3a-6eabbd6d96d4">Dare Obasanjo aka Carnage4Life - The Sex &amp; Cash Theory</a>
<br />
<br />THE SEX &amp; CASH THEORY: "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." - Hugh Macleod
<br />
<br />Dare Obasanjo's take on that :-
<br />"That blog post sums up a lot of my thinking recently. Designing the classes in System.Xml is a decent day job but I only really light up in front of a computer when I'm fixing bugs or adding features in RSS Bandit. One pays the bills, the other allows me to express myself without artificial limitation in my medium of choice."
<br />
<br />My take :-
<br />Dare works for Microsoft, from where I am thats suppose to be super cool and 'dont-have-to-work-for-day', 'only-fun' type of a job, but even he doesn't consider his day job as 'sexy', so what more can I say, for a long time I have been looking for a sexy job and this took me through many employers in as many years, Only now and with the curent job that have i realised and accepted this duality, that its not about fun, its about cash, and I should stop looking at my job and work as sexy, because its not, we are doing business. This has definitely made things better for me and put a lot of internal conflicts and unease to rest.

<small><p class="post-date">Jul 30, 2004</p></small>
Last weekend, I managed to go to Bangalore and spend it there with Paul (my cousin brother) and Lily (cousin sister) and her family (Jason, his friend Steven and parents). It was nice although the whole big thing about Bangalore being this and that is in my opinion overstated. The best thing (as I have realised) about any place is the people. By that measure, obviously Kolkata is the best place :-)
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am not going to Bangalore again this weekend so I will spend the weekend alone here in Kochi. Its about 10 mins since the last of the office fellows have left and now I am alone. When I was back home, I always wanted space, personal time, and indeed at times I would just shield myself from everything and just be lost. But now, I crave family and home.
<br />
<br /><strong>Life is strange,
<br />when its hot, want cold,
<br />when its cold, want hot,
<br />always wanting what is not.
<br /></strong>
<br />
<br />Don't have plans for the weekend other than, wash underwear and try to get Caroline's school program running again. I have got Jackie Chan's movie Shanghai Nights dumped in one of the pcs, so that should give me about 1.5 hours of entertainment and hopefully inspiration to work hard with determination.
<br />
<br />Will try to do some work for a change in weekends too.

Funny thing, after a month long rest at home, I am slowly getting back to writing code and thinking about logic again. only when I work do I actually realise how much I enjoy programing. I can go from one thing to another and never really get tired or bored.
<br />
<br />Caroline wanted to blog about her what she does and her thoughts and I spent hours fixing my xml based blog application till 3 am today.
<br />
<br />I have this little problem, sometimes I get so much hooked into the enjoyment part of my work that I forget that I have to finish stuff too, so we can deliver, so we can get paid, so I can get paid. This is one thing I have had a lot of problem with since the beginning.

<small><p class="post-date">Jul 14, 2004</p></small>
I left Kochi(Cochin), Kerala a few years back, deciding to settle back in Kolkata. To say the least, its been a very difficult ride for me since then career-wise, although things seems to have started on the upside when I joined MindTeck, again I was given an opportunity to come back here in Kochi and start another chapter in my short but very fragile career book. So here I am, again back in Kerala, back with some old friends, back to (hopefully) better financial times. The weather is good, better than Kolkata, and the place seems exactly like before. Only thing thats really changed is me and my job details. Last time I was here, I travelled in Sleeper Class train, this time, AC Train :-) . Last time I was surviving on a meagre 4500/- per month and eating plain dosa for dinner, now, well its much better.
<br />
<br />When I actually reached here and was in the hotel room at night, I couldn't believe that I was actually away from home and in another place. Sometimes I find it difficult reconsiling with the current situation - that I am away from home, different place, different language, different food, different almost everything. Only when one is away does one realise what home really is. Its actually painful at times (I guess everyone who leaves home feels the same) but its better than last time around when I actually cried :(
<br />
<br />I pray to God that he protects my family and wife Caroline. I think this is the first time I'll write in public that I really really miss her. If only she was with me, things would have been very different, I never realised this, but she is everything I need. Hopefully things will turn out better than last time and I'll get her here soon instead of me leaving and going back.

ok, I didn't fly. but I travelled from Guwahati to Kolkata in an air plane. Caroline and I boarded a Sahara air plane today on our journey back from Shillong (there is lot I want to say about the Shillong trip, but via another post). This is the second time I am travelling in air but I was a small kid the first time around and can't remember anything, so effectively this is the first air travel experience for me !!
<br />
<br />I wish I had something to write on while I was looking out of the window. I was looking at this amazing scene and all sorts of words and descriptions were going through my head. Lets see if I can describe what, according to me, it looked like, It was as if we were above a desert of clouds, or snow, like the atlantic - full white, in the distance I could see the powerful orange light of the sun and around it was like a river of gold flowing down, or rather oasis of gold. Prior to all this, I could see the landscape of Assam's fields and river Saraighat (I guess it was that), like those we see in Discovery channel.
<br />
<br />I marvel at technology, technology that enables me to reach from one place to another in about an hour whereas using the train it takes about 20 hours. Huge difference. Yes, I had those often described as 'near-vomit' feelings as the plane was taking off but its not really a problem. What engineering must have gone inside the plane to make it fly flawlessly. Makes me want to work harder and learn more.

I bought a digital camera (<a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=1055&amp;pq-locale=en_US">Kodak Cx6200</a>)few days back and since then I have been clicking photos, have clicked about 40 of them already !! no only a few of them are mine, I have even clicked a few silly ones like the one I took of the digital taxi meter.
<br />
<br />Good thing is we can transfer all the photos to the PC and empty the memory out. Bad thing is it needs battery.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am learning some photography skills (this is my first own camera) and find it difficult to get an entire view into the preview rectangle of the camera, I guess thats the challenge (want more, have less is actually the challenge of life). Will post some photos here or link to the page that has it.

I don't know why, but I hate to leave jobs, yet I have changed jobs too frequently for my own good. What did I do here whole day ?
<br />
<br />browsing the net, what else, catching up on my blog/article reading. Plus, I managed to setup free web hosting for a techie group called Kolkatanet that I am part of, also setup a private discussion group in Yahoo groups, (I am not linking them here cause I don't want this blog to come up too in public). Life changes again tomorow onwards, as I will be unemployed and (hopefully) relaxing for next few days till the 9th, I am very excited about the digital camera I'll be buying before I travel to Shillong for Edmund's (friend &amp; brother-in-law) engagement. We'll see some photos then.. Hope and pray that BDTech is where I will settle down for a while..

Very soon I will again be changing jobs. Frustrating, very frustrating, either its me, or its my luck. Somehow, I manage to find reason(s) or reason/opportunity comes and I have decide to move. Where will I be next year this time ? only time will tell, only thing I can guaratee about is I'll still be hacking code... :-) hopefully in C#/.NET.
<br />
<br />One thing I want to get right is my ability to save money, after all these years, I still find myself time and again in near empty pocket situations. This has to go in my resolution.

I started blogging at <a href="http://richard.rediffblogs.com">Rediff Blogs</a> and it still has my blogs. I am moving now to blogger as I find it better than rediffblogs. But it was rediffblogs that got me into blogging.
<br />
<br />I have tech blogs at <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richardhsu">GeekDojo</a> and a <a href="http://richardhsu.blogspot.com">collection of tech (programming mostly) resources on the internet</a>.
<br />
<br />But here, I will post all non-tech stuff like what I did, what I think about certain things etc. Mainly for myself to read in future but also as a means of communicating with my friends.
