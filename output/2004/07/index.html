Last weekend, I managed to go to Bangalore and spend it there with Paul (my cousin brother) and Lily (cousin sister) and her family (Jason, his friend Steven and parents). It was nice although the whole big thing about Bangalore being this and that is in my opinion overstated. The best thing (as I have realised) about any place is the people. By that measure, obviously Kolkata is the best place :-)
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am not going to Bangalore again this weekend so I will spend the weekend alone here in Kochi. Its about 10 mins since the last of the office fellows have left and now I am alone. When I was back home, I always wanted space, personal time, and indeed at times I would just shield myself from everything and just be lost. But now, I crave family and home.
<br />
<br /><strong>Life is strange,
<br />when its hot, want cold,
<br />when its cold, want hot,
<br />always wanting what is not.
<br /></strong>
<br />
<br />Don't have plans for the weekend other than, wash underwear and try to get Caroline's school program running again. I have got Jackie Chan's movie Shanghai Nights dumped in one of the pcs, so that should give me about 1.5 hours of entertainment and hopefully inspiration to work hard with determination.
<br />
<br />Will try to do some work for a change in weekends too.

Funny thing, after a month long rest at home, I am slowly getting back to writing code and thinking about logic again. only when I work do I actually realise how much I enjoy programing. I can go from one thing to another and never really get tired or bored.
<br />
<br />Caroline wanted to blog about her what she does and her thoughts and I spent hours fixing my xml based blog application till 3 am today.
<br />
<br />I have this little problem, sometimes I get so much hooked into the enjoyment part of my work that I forget that I have to finish stuff too, so we can deliver, so we can get paid, so I can get paid. This is one thing I have had a lot of problem with since the beginning.

I left Kochi(Cochin), Kerala a few years back, deciding to settle back in Kolkata. To say the least, its been a very difficult ride for me since then career-wise, although things seems to have started on the upside when I joined MindTeck, again I was given an opportunity to come back here in Kochi and start another chapter in my short but very fragile career book. So here I am, again back in Kerala, back with some old friends, back to (hopefully) better financial times. The weather is good, better than Kolkata, and the place seems exactly like before. Only thing thats really changed is me and my job details. Last time I was here, I travelled in Sleeper Class train, this time, AC Train :-) . Last time I was surviving on a meagre 4500/- per month and eating plain dosa for dinner, now, well its much better.
<br />
<br />When I actually reached here and was in the hotel room at night, I couldn't believe that I was actually away from home and in another place. Sometimes I find it difficult reconsiling with the current situation - that I am away from home, different place, different language, different food, different almost everything. Only when one is away does one realise what home really is. Its actually painful at times (I guess everyone who leaves home feels the same) but its better than last time around when I actually cried :(
<br />
<br />I pray to God that he protects my family and wife Caroline. I think this is the first time I'll write in public that I really really miss her. If only she was with me, things would have been very different, I never realised this, but she is everything I need. Hopefully things will turn out better than last time and I'll get her here soon instead of me leaving and going back.
