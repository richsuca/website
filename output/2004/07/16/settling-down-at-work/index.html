Funny thing, after a month long rest at home, I am slowly getting back to writing code and thinking about logic again. only when I work do I actually realise how much I enjoy programing. I can go from one thing to another and never really get tired or bored.
<br />
<br />Caroline wanted to blog about her what she does and her thoughts and I spent hours fixing my xml based blog application till 3 am today.
<br />
<br />I have this little problem, sometimes I get so much hooked into the enjoyment part of my work that I forget that I have to finish stuff too, so we can deliver, so we can get paid, so I can get paid. This is one thing I have had a lot of problem with since the beginning.
