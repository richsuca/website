<p>"... So. Specs are good, but not if nobody reads them. As a spec-writer, you have to <i>trick people</i> into reading your stuff, and you should also probably make an effort not to <strong>cause any already-too-small brains to leak out through eye-sockets</strong>.... " - <!--StartFragment --> <em>Joel Spolsky</em></p><p>The 'already-too-small brains' refers to stupid non-tech managers who don't understand geeks but has an influence on them :-)</p><p>I was reading the article from which the above extract is taken (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000033.html">full article here</a>) and found the author's expression (marked in bold) really really funny, so thought of putting it up here.</p>

I am listening to Chris Phillip's instrumental 'To the One Who Knows' and its one of those really moving sounds, one can't help but shake one's head to the rhythm. Some moments are better than others...

<br />I quite like this one, especially the 10x optical zoom in it as I find no-zoom a big limitation in my current Kodak cx6200. Maybe if I am disciplined enough with my savings, I could afford this one in Christmas (Rediff listed price Rs. 28000/-)

<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7b8dc7cd-033a-4cb8-ba3a-6eabbd6d96d4">Dare Obasanjo aka Carnage4Life - The Sex &amp; Cash Theory</a>
<br />
<br />THE SEX &amp; CASH THEORY: "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." - Hugh Macleod
<br />
<br />Dare Obasanjo's take on that :-
<br />"That blog post sums up a lot of my thinking recently. Designing the classes in System.Xml is a decent day job but I only really light up in front of a computer when I'm fixing bugs or adding features in RSS Bandit. One pays the bills, the other allows me to express myself without artificial limitation in my medium of choice."
<br />
<br />My take :-
<br />Dare works for Microsoft, from where I am thats suppose to be super cool and 'dont-have-to-work-for-day', 'only-fun' type of a job, but even he doesn't consider his day job as 'sexy', so what more can I say, for a long time I have been looking for a sexy job and this took me through many employers in as many years, Only now and with the curent job that have i realised and accepted this duality, that its not about fun, its about cash, and I should stop looking at my job and work as sexy, because its not, we are doing business. This has definitely made things better for me and put a lot of internal conflicts and unease to rest.
