<br />
<br />THE SEX &amp; CASH THEORY: "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." - Hugh Macleod
<br />
<br />Dare Obasanjo's take on that :-
<br />"That blog post sums up a lot of my thinking recently. Designing the classes in System.Xml is a decent day job but I only really light up in front of a computer when I'm fixing bugs or adding features in RSS Bandit. One pays the bills, the other allows me to express myself without artificial limitation in my medium of choice."
<br />
<br />My take :-
<br />Dare works for Microsoft, from where I am thats suppose to be super cool and 'dont-have-to-work-for-day', 'only-fun' type of a job, but even he doesn't consider his day job as 'sexy', so what more can I say, for a long time I have been looking for a sexy job and this took me through many employers in as many years, Only now and with the curent job that have i realised and accepted this duality, that its not about fun, its about cash, and I should stop looking at my job and work as sexy, because its not, we are doing business. This has definitely made things better for me and put a lot of internal conflicts and unease to rest.
