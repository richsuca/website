I don't know why, but I hate to leave jobs, yet I have changed jobs too frequently for my own good. What did I do here whole day ?
<br />
<br />browsing the net, what else, catching up on my blog/article reading. Plus, I managed to setup free web hosting for a techie group called Kolkatanet that I am part of, also setup a private discussion group in Yahoo groups, (I am not linking them here cause I don't want this blog to come up too in public). Life changes again tomorow onwards, as I will be unemployed and (hopefully) relaxing for next few days till the 9th, I am very excited about the digital camera I'll be buying before I travel to Shillong for Edmund's (friend &amp; brother-in-law) engagement. We'll see some photos then.. Hope and pray that BDTech is where I will settle down for a while..

Very soon I will again be changing jobs. Frustrating, very frustrating, either its me, or its my luck. Somehow, I manage to find reason(s) or reason/opportunity comes and I have decide to move. Where will I be next year this time ? only time will tell, only thing I can guaratee about is I'll still be hacking code... :-) hopefully in C#/.NET.
<br />
<br />One thing I want to get right is my ability to save money, after all these years, I still find myself time and again in near empty pocket situations. This has to go in my resolution.

<small><p>May 16, 2004</p></small>
I started blogging at <a href="http://richard.rediffblogs.com">Rediff Blogs</a> and it still has my blogs. I am moving now to blogger as I find it better than rediffblogs. But it was rediffblogs that got me into blogging.
<br />
<br />I have tech blogs at <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richardhsu">GeekDojo</a> and a <a href="http://richardhsu.blogspot.com">collection of tech (programming mostly) resources on the internet</a>.
<br />
<br />But here, I will post all non-tech stuff like what I did, what I think about certain things etc. Mainly for myself to read in future but also as a means of communicating with my friends.
