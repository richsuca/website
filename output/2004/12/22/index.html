Was in Kolkata yesterday, am in Chennai today, sort of stranded as I am headed for Kochi, but, again its Holiday season, so tickets are <u>extremely</u> difficult to get. No buses running till after Christmas, have asked an agent to try for a train ticket, if I am lucky, I'll hopping on the train at around 2am [a few hours from now].
<br />
<br />In short, have been travelling way too much lately, not sure where I will be. Everything has been very uncertain since June this year. I hate to pack and unpack and watch people say 'bye'. Don't like it at all. Yet, I have opted for it.
<br />
<br />Hope I have better options next year. Oh Santa!! You know what will be written in the little piece of paper under my pillow on Christmas eve.
