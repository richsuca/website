<hr /><h2><a href="/2004/10/26/the-joy-of-reading-stories">The Joy of Reading Stories</a></h2>
<p>Oct 26, 2004</p>
I am subscribed to <a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/">WordSmith's A Word A Day</a> and today's word was <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/horatio_alger.html">Horatio Alger</a>. That's not the reason for this post, the interesting part is that the mail had a <a href="http://gutenberg.org/author/Horatio+Alger">link</a> to an eBook which had Horatio Alger's stories. I don't know exactly what made me go to the next page and download the <a href="http://gutenberg.org/etext/5623">"The Young Explorer"</a>. So far, I've read only the first chapter and its so much fun. Its a book a child can read. Simple and very interesting, reminds me of my young self. :-)
<br />
<br />Here is something I find the most interesting in chapter 1: Ben, a boy of 16 says to his Uncle "I want to go to California."
<br />
<br />I am curious and excited about what young Ben will do in California, how he'll survive alone, the people he'll meet and the trials &amp; tribulations that he'll go through to find his fortune.
<br />
<br />I am child at heart and there's a smile on my face, just like a child who has got a new toy to play with.
<hr /><h2><a href="/2004/10/23/a-tale-of-two-blogs">A Tale of Two Blogs</a></h2>
<p>Oct 23, 2004</p>
There are two non-tech blogs that I read often. One of them is by my friend Anita and another by Deepak Gulati, a Microsoft guy that I interacted with over email. Both of their blogs have one thing that draws me to them. You read things totally original. You read something which is very personal. Well, this blog of mine is also original &amp; personal, but it is written in very simple [dry] english and there is nothing poetic. They have a natural gift for poetry, art and they are more sensitive than me. Anita's blog has more poetry while Deepak's has a lot of photos coupled with his detailed descriptions of his observations [he sort of operates at a very very low level in english language, he uses a lot of big words, the kind I get every day from 'A Word A Day'].
<br />
<br />I am sure, their writings have influenced me in some manner small or big. I am not linking their blogs here cause I don't know if they would want me to.
<br />
<br />Its been very enjoyable [brings some life into my geek world] so far and I pray that their pens [err. their keystrokes] keeps flowing [err. {no equivalent description for flowing}]. :-)

<p>Oct 17, 2004</p>
I was creating nero disc images of the three VCDs of my wedding today, when I opened the second CD to view it. It brought back memories, happy ones, of my wedding day. That part was showing us about to start serving tea to everyone young and old.. forwarded it a little bit and it reached a point where we were asked to kiss and were posing for the photographer, then there was this huge demand for me to carry her. :-)
<br />
<br />My heart gives a million thanks to Michael Huang, a friend who volunteered to video our wedding with his personal video camera for free. We had [stupidly] thought of cutting cost and not opting for a professional video guy. If Michael had not done it, I wouldn't have any today. On hind sight, we should have had Peter Shu [an excellent pro and friend's dad] video our wedding also. I think I asked him only two days before, he was already booked for that day :-( [stupid me]. Anyways, Michael was God sent [God has always covered for my stupidity] and he did a decent job of it.
<br />
<br />So many friends, relatives, neighbours etc. were present and it was so nice of everyone to have come and attended. I realised how ugly and stupid I look [thank God, Caroline liked/ignored my face]. It was an all happy occassion for everyone. I can't believe I went through all that with Caroline and me at the centre of it all. I am a shy person and now when I think about it, I managed ok.
<br />
<br />Its nearing 2 years now..  we're getting along, working things out.
