Seeing my son go to the babysitter is painfull. He is weeks shy of 2 years, but knows that he has to go, and does not complain, but you can see it in his face(expression of resignation) and his good bye is very soft and has a tone of sadness. The babysitter loves him and takes very good care of him and I am sure when he does reach his home, he is his normal active-happy self.
