<p>To get Two-Factor authentication (or what Google calls 2-Step Verification) working with Gmail and Mac Mail app, you need to enter the App password in two places (incoming and outgoing).</p>
<ol>
<li>In Mail &gt; Preferences, go to Accounts</li>
<li>Click on Google, enter the App Password in the Password field (this is for incoming mails)</li>
<li>Click the drop down for Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP), pick ‘Edit SMTP Server List…’, paste the App password again. This is for outgoing mail.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same applies for outlook.com (live.com, hotmail.com) or yahoo mail. You need to enter the application specific password for both incoming and outgoing.</p>
