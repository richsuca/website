These things happened today.

#### Adele

Adele: Dad, now my knee hurts.  
Me: What about your thigh? Is it better?  
Adele: Thigh doesn’t hurt anymore.  
Me: At least it’s going down.

#### Parking

I stopped the car right in front of the busy Costco entrance to load things. I thought it would be a 2 seconds pit stop, but it took longer. 

Dumb idea. All cars behind me had to go around. 

One dude in a Mercedes Benz SUV yelled at me as he made the pass: What The F@&$ Man!

#### Returns

I dreaded returning the swimsuit at Costco on a Saturday morning. Instead of a 20 people queue, I was surprised to see only one person in front of me!

I asked the Costco guy walking by: "What happened? No lines?"

He said: "They knew you were coming."
