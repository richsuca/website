Ever since arriving here I've tried tea from different places. One word - sucks.<br /><br />Today, I tried it again, from Tim Horton's. I didn't get much sleep or rest for last 2 days and had a coffee in the morning to keep my eyes open. It worked for only a few hours, again my eyes were getting all sleepy and wet, I needed another coffee. But realising that 2 coffees would be too much for a day, I went with tea instead, 'steeped' tea to be more precise [as if its any different]. Steeped tea is suppose to be brewed tea just like we have in India vs. the tea bag style.<br /> <br />One sip of the tea and again, it sucks. Its just like the tea one gets on the train in India, but the train chaloo chai costs only Rs 4/- or Rs. 5/- per cup while this one costs me INR 40/-!! and its from the No. 1 coffee seller in Canada.<br /> <br />The tea we make at home is definitely much better, still not like the milky bihari-style chai we get in Anmol or from that place in Behala near our shoe shop.<br /> <br />Lesson of the day, don't pay for tea in Canada, have coffee instead.
