This weblog will be a way to reach my friends and family at home. To help bring about some connection between my life and that of my family and friends. Time flies by and with this weblog, I hope to be able to make things more interesting, memorable and hopefully more honest.<br /><br />'Just a minute' ? well, i have been procrastinating with just about everything in life, job search, calling people up, writing mails etc. and thought that this blog will make me take at least one minute a day [or in a few days] to sit down and <span style="font-weight:bold;">think</span>.<br /><br />Feel free to share this blog with others who might be interested to hear from me. I will appreciate if you take time and write a comment. Thanks.<br /><br />remember, the website is <span style="font-weight:bold;">"richardhsu.net"</span>
