Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a time to get together with friends and family, exchange presents, take time off from work, and refresh before the new year.

It is also a time to look back at the year that past, consider how it was spent, memories made, remember those that have pass.

My family brings me joy, meaning, and purpose to my life. But I also miss the family that I am part of but are oceans away: my parents, brothers, and the extended family in India. 

This is an immigrant's pain. An immigrant's sacrifice. An immigrant's bargain.

It is the asterisk that has been there for the past 12 years, in all the headlines of my life, reminding me of the family that I left as I embarked on new life in Canada to make my own.

I miss them, wish them well, and pray for them.
