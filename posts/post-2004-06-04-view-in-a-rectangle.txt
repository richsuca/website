I bought a digital camera (<a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=1055&amp;pq-locale=en_US">Kodak Cx6200</a>)few days back and since then I have been clicking photos, have clicked about 40 of them already !! no only a few of them are mine, I have even clicked a few silly ones like the one I took of the digital taxi meter.
<br />
<br />Good thing is we can transfer all the photos to the PC and empty the memory out. Bad thing is it needs battery.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I am learning some photography skills (this is my first own camera) and find it difficult to get an entire view into the preview rectangle of the camera, I guess thats the challenge (want more, have less is actually the challenge of life). Will post some photos here or link to the page that has it.
