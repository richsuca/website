I am listening to Girish Karnad read President Abdul Kalam's autobiography "Wings of Fire" which amongst other things also talks about the failures that the Indian space and missile programmes faced. He remembers fondly the naive criticisms he received while the Agni missile launch was delayed time and again due to technical reasons. Hearing him, I now realise how easily we criticize and try to frame people for their faults without thinking twice about what we are doing. What good purpose will our snide comments serve ? Are we helping, if not, then we should be supportive and keep quiet.<br /><br />From today, I will keep this in mind and hopefully hurt people lesser.
