I went to the grocery store yesterday.

Things I touched

- The letterbox (posted a survey from Costco[^covid19-ftr-1])
- The shopping cart
- All the items I picked up
- Fridge door for the milk
- Fridge door for the ice cream
- Plastic divider at the checkout counter[^covid19-ftr-2]
- The chain to link the shopping carts

The local grocery store is relatively smaller so there are many narrow corners and aisles. I was within 3 feet of people a few times.

I sanitized my hands at the entrance, sanitized it again after I returned the cart.

At the checkout counter, I felt itchy on my cheek and scratched it, then realized the horror of what I did ðŸ˜¨.

After reaching home, I looked at all the food items and wondered: how do I sanitize them?! I didn't.

We touch so many things that are touched by others. Unless we completely stop going out or accepting deliveries, I can't think of a way to avoid it. I guess it is a matter of reducing probabilities. No wonder the US and Canada are heading towards mass infections and deaths.

[^covid19-ftr-1]: Costco wanted to know how my recent return was.
[^covid19-ftr-2]: Wasn't necessary as they were only letting one person place items on the conveyer belt.
