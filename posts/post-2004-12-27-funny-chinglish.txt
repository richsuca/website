<p>Following is an extract from <a href="https://richardhsu.net/2004/10/26/the-joy-of-reading-stories/">&quot;The Young Explorer&quot; by Horatio Alger</a> :-</p>
<p>In this part, a group of american gold miners are bullying and questioning a Mongolian [generalised by the author as a Chinaman]. The funny part is about the way a Mongolian [and indeed a Chinese] speaks english.</p>
<p>Irish-American : &quot;...Where do you come from?&quot;</p>
<p>Mongolian [named Ki Sing] : &quot;Me come from 'Flisco.&quot; [Its suppose to be 'f<span style="font-weight:bold;">r</span>isco', short for San Francisco]</p>
<p>It is well known that a Chinaman cannot pronounce the letter r,</p>
<p>which in his mouth softens to l, in some cases producing a ludicrous effect.</p>
<p>&quot;What have you come here for, Cy King, or whatever your name is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name Ki Sing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's a haythen name; anyhow,&quot; remarked Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I'd have such a name, I'd go widout one intirely. Did you</p>
<p>hear the gintleman ask you what you came here for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bling me,&quot; answered Ki Sing shrewdly.</p>
<p>There was another laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chinee ain't no fool!&quot; said Dick Roberts.</p>
<p>&quot;What made you leave China?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Me come to Amelica fol gold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, ho! That's it, is it? What are you going to do with your gold</p>
<p>when you find it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cally it back to China.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And when you've callied it back, what'll you do then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me mally wife, have good time and plenty money to buy lice.&quot;</p>
