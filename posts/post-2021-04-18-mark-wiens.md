Mark Wiens Quotes

I have been an on-and-off fan of Mark Wiens’ food videos. Last summer, the wife and I watched every video in the _Round the World Trip for Food_ [playlist][1], where he travelled to nine cities in Asia, Europe, and the US in about a month. He started in Bangkok, then Mumbai, Muscat, Istanbul, Rome, Stockholm, Barcelona, Lisbon, New York City, Hong Kong, and back to Bangkok.

We watched one video a day, so it took us weeks to watch all 39 videos. It had all things we like about his videos:  We travelled virtually to new places with him and learnt about the food in those places, but what I enjoyed the most is his description of the food, the eating experience, and his expressions as he tastes them (sometimes, when I enjoy the food, I copy his signature head tilt too).

When I give a spoonful of rice to my kids, my mouth opens up as well. I have noticed this with others too. If I enjoyed watching him travel and eat, imagine how it would be doing it in person. His videos make me hungry for food and travel, especially to places like Thailand where I haven’t been. Before the pandemic, we had plans to visit Europe for 2020, and I had plans to visit India in 2021. It has been long. 

Anyways, back to Mark Wiens. My son Aiden was watching a Mark Wiens video with us one day. Aiden also has a YouTube channel where he shares videos of him playing video games with his friends, including live commentary. I asked him to work in Mark Wiens’s quotes in his next video. He agreed. So I wrote down all the interesting Mark Wiens quotes from the video we were watching.

These are the quotes:

- Say Hello
- This is a huge production
- Almost ridiculous
- Oh, Wow!
- So good
- That’s the life-changer right there
- Amazing Day
- Oh, that’s good too
- Ultimate Best
- Unbelievable
- Awesome
- Oh, Man!
- Get ready
- That will change your life
- That’s style man
- Loosen the belt
- Incredibly Special Day
- I am going to take you and me to ____
- In the basket
- That is all you can ask for
- Oh, that’s insane
- That’s a game-changer
- That’s absolutely incredible
- Things are really starting to heat up
- I can’t wait
- Absolutely insane
 
To help Aiden work these into his commentary while playing Minecraft, my daughter Adele and I wrote these into pieces of paper and showed him one by one. He did manage to improvise all of them into his video, but many got cut in the editing.

[Watch it][2] yourself and see if you can figure them out. Enjoy!
