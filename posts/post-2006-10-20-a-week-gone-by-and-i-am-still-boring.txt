Its one week now in Manhattan. A week of many firsts. The hotel room I am lodged in is on<br />the 36th Floor! Its the highest in terms of altitude I have stayed in. I saw the Statue of<br />Liberty for the first time (from the shores of Manhattan). First time I am staying in a four<br />star hotel for more than a day. Crowne Plaza on Broadway near Time Square is a fine hotel.<br />Had the most expensive steak of my life (I did learn a few things about steak but don't<br />remember enough to write about). Using wireless internet for the first time.<br /><br />I bought a tripod today from J&amp;R at Broadway &amp; Ann St. near City Hall Park. Look forward to<br />making night photos of Brooklyn bridge and Time Square.<br /><br />Food ? I had good Steak, Italian(pizza, pasta, meatballs, grill chicken &amp; salad), Chinese<br />(Szechuan-style prawn with peccan/Ginger chicken with vegetables), Indian(fish curry, Rajma,<br />aaloo mattar on rice and one naan), Thai(Pad See-Ew), Vietnamese (the ever delicious noodle<br />soup) and Mexican(Carnitas Burrito). Of course I had to have the street special (Shish Kebob<br />on bun) and breakfast and coffee from Dunkin Doughnuts and Startbucks. OK, so I mentioned<br />Steak as if it was a country but then I am not sure how else to classify it.<br /><br />While I made a conscious decision of not going to the same restaurant more than once, I<br />didn't realise that I had food from so many different countries!<br /><br />I have plans to visit at least 4 places this weekdend and make photos. Lets hope the weather is suitable.<br /><br />(My interest in writing has declined and it shows. I don't spend enough time thinking and rewriting. This boring blog is another sign that I need to refocus my energies on being more lively)
