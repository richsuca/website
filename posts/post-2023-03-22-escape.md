This is a true story.

My brother shared two photos of a parrot that flew out of the cage. Ashok, the parrot's owner was watching, as Babai (another resident) was trying to make the parrot fly back.

I wrote a poem inspired by the parrot's daring escape attempt. My daughter Adele drew the picture from the original photos.

parrot wanted to explore the world  
but babai brought out his merch  
parrot watched babai's lungi unfurl  
and it scared it off its perch

it wants to be free  
it doesn't want the cage  
but Ashok won't let it be  
not at this stage

it tried through the dental window  
but got lost inside  
the screaming patient, though  
got a short respite

now it's back in the cage  
wondering when it will be  
tired, but full of rage  
when will it be free?
