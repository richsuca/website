<p>I finally got my first Digital SLR camera. As expected, it's a Nikon D40 body with the 35/1.8 DX lens. It does exactly what I wanted: Make good photos indoors with available light. But it has also started me on another more philosophical thing.</p>
<p>When I started making photos, my goal was to capture a moment in a frame, as is. No manipulation, no artistic touch (as if I have any). All these years, my goalÂ has been to reproduce reality with photography. So the photographs I upload are exactly as it came from the camera (with cropping applied if needed). The bokeh, color and light I get with the DSLR makes the photograph look good but quite different from reality. This has got me thinking about the artistic aspects of a photography.</p>

<p>So, this year, I will start to apply more than just cropping to &quot;finish&quot; my photographs.</p>
<p>Another thing I will do more is take photo of people rather than only things.</p>
