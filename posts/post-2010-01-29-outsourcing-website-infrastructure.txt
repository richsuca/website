<p>I finally outsourced my website hosting after running it at home for over 2 years. This is intended to be an interim measure before I move it Google App Engine (maybe 2011). Wordpress is an impressive blogging program with a good balance of ease of use and flexibility.</p>
<p>This is part of my list of things that I will let go of in 2010. Not having to run a website from home means no need to have a computer always on and connected. Now I can repurpose the computer for something else (try a *nix desktop again!).</p>
<p>Another thing I let go of recently is the dual monitor setup(having used it for over 1.5 years). Now I have only one monitor. The objective is to remove clutter, simplify which should help me focus better.</p>
