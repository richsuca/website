Adele noticed the _No Smoking_ signs at the train stop and said:  
Daddy! Look! No smoking!

A lady standing by heard it and smiled. 

Later, inside the train, Adele noticed _No Smoking_ signs again and said:  
Daddy! Look! No smoking!

The same lady, now sitting across from us smiled and said:  
She is a sweetie. Like mommy, taking care of Daddy.
