I slept at 3am due to a dinner social event that ended late and also my pre-sleep bad habit of labouring over specification, benchmark, review, and pricing of desktop computer parts and camera equipment. [G.A.S][1] attack comes and goes but it is especially brutal between the November to January Birthday-Christmas season. I am close to the bottom of that now but that is a story for another day.

So this morning, sleepy and lethargic, I was vacuuming the basement and not enjoying it at all when I found a small toy in a corner. Recognising it as a Shopkin, I gave it to my daughter who was happy to get it back. She said "Oh! that's my [Jelly Bean Joe][3]<sup>*</sup>".

And just like that, life interesting again!

* Online, I found references to Jelly B. but not _Jelly Bean Joe_ so I asked my son. He educated me that it is a character from the TV show Odd Squad.
