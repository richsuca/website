Unlike most people, my vehicle of choice is a cycle, I don't own one yet, but when I have $300 dollars to spare for myself next summer, I will go for this cruiser.<br /><br />How did I learn about this, in a subway advertisement by some soya food company. Actually, there is a contest to win such a cycle which I have entered. Lets see, maybe I wouldn't have to shell out money or wait till next summer.<br /><br />I bought myself a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardhsu/">digital camera</a> last christmas, i am saving up some something again this christmas, computer upgrade ? an SLR camera ? a cruiser bicycle ? don't know..
