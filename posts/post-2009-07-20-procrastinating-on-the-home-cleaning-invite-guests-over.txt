<p>I was procrastinating on the weekend vacuum+moping+re-arrange+garbage disposal routine last weekend until a cousin of my called to say if they could come by and return my computer back. How long would it take to come? about 30 mins.</p>
<p>As if my life depended on it, I went full speed and before they reached my place (they were only a few minutes late), the foyer, living room, kitchen, my son's toy room, my computer room were all nice and clean and tidy! I don't remember seeing all the rooms this tidy in recent weeks and its quite enjoyable now thanks to visitors.</p>
