<p>Tomorrow, I volunteered to cook Chicken Curry for the gathering with friendly neighbours. I don't remember cooking Chicken Curry before although I have a general idea of the steps involved(having assisted the wife several times). I have two options before me. Consult the wife for her recipe or look it up on the internet. Since this is suppose to be independently cooked, I will use <a href="http://youtu.be/NRovp9c9e-4" title="chicken currry">Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana's recipe</a> from YouTube and run it by my wife to see what she thinks. She is an experienced and well reviewed cook, so I would not be surprised if she is not excited with my decision to go with this and not her tried and well reviewed recipe.</p>
<p>It would be more of a challenge and potentially more of a surprise to everyone if I try something different. Let's see how it turns out.</p>

<p>Update(Dec 28th 2.23am ET): While I did not follow all the steps accurately(over grated onions, did not cook tomato properly, mixed onion, garlic and ginger paste together), I did use the ingredients and for the most part, what I cooked was from this recipe so the recipe and the video deserves credit for the good biased reviews I got. Will definitely retry this and follow the steps more accurately the next time.</p>
