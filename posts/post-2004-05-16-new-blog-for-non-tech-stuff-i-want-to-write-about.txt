I started blogging at <a href="http://richard.rediffblogs.com">Rediff Blogs</a> and it still has my blogs. I am moving now to blogger as I find it better than rediffblogs. But it was rediffblogs that got me into blogging.
<br />
<br />I have tech blogs at <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richardhsu">GeekDojo</a> and a <a href="http://richardhsu.blogspot.com">collection of tech (programming mostly) resources on the internet</a>.
<br />
<br />But here, I will post all non-tech stuff like what I did, what I think about certain things etc. Mainly for myself to read in future but also as a means of communicating with my friends.
