<div>Asked by a geek-friend about like in Canada, here is what I came up with :-<br /><br /></div><div>Life in Canada, just like everything in life,  has good, bad and ugly.</div><div> </div><div>Good:</div><ul><li>I can  attend <a href="http://www.learn2asp.net/Campaign.aspx">3 webcasts</a> and get Visual Studio 2005  [Standard Edition], an ASP.NET 2.0 book all for free!! [this offer is only  available in US and Canada, so can't apply from India, but you can still attend  the webcasts] </li><li>Anybody in Canada can  buy an <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/07/ipod-mini-just-one-week-savings-at-min.html">iPod mini with just one week's pay </a>or the  all new Intel Core Solo powered <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macmini/">Apple Mini </a>with 2-weeks of work, any work.  </li><li>A month of <a href="http://www.shoprogers.com/Store/Cable/InternetContent/extreme.asp">6 mbps Hi-Speed internet connection</a> can be  paid with only half a days pay, again doing any job.</li><li>You can choose to work just half a day or a  just a day and get paid only for that. You can find plenty of half a day or  Saturday only jobs if you want.</li><li>Eating  at McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken is like eating deem-bhaji-thaali. Eat it  everyday if you are the thin kind [which you are Neo :-) ] </li><li>C$ 1 == INR 38!! </li><li>People who drive buses or collect garbage earn  more than most executives. </li></ul><p>Bad</p><ul><li>I don't  write code for money, so you spend 8 hours everyday doing something you <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/10/nothing-is-really-work-unless.html">would NOT do for free</a>. </li><li>I miss the outdoors due to the <a href="http://richardhsu.net/weblog/2005/11/i-saw-snow.html">cold and snow</a> </li><li>I eat too much fast food, because I can.  </li><li>I am in danger of loosing my Indian  accent and decent english. </li><li>I see too  much flesh all around [often within touching distance] ;-). </li></ul><p>Ugly</p><ul><li>I miss  home and everyone at home. </li><li>Last but  not the least, I miss Kolkatanet and all the geek friends like you. </li></ul><p>But life changes fast and so will my list of  Good/Bad but I am afraid Ugly will remain Ugly for some years at least.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
