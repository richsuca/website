<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I 'arranged' the dinner tonight, the word 'arranged' is being used instead of 'cooked' or 'bought' because it was neither fully cooked by me nor was all of it bought pre-cooked.</p> <p>Anyways, here is what I did:</p> <p>Visited Sobeys nearby and bought the following:-</p> <p>a) Parisienne Potatoes [large size 258 grams] - Ready to eat</p> <p>b) Campbell's vegetable condensed soup [one can]</p> <p>c) Villaggio Italian style garlic bread.</p> <p>A friend Barabara had bought us 3 Kosher Lazor Louisiana Style chicken sausages [also from Sobeys] last week when she visited. The sausage was to be the piece de resistance.</p> <p>So I boiled the sausaged in a pan and then pan fried it in very little oil [under the watchfull direction of Caroline]</p> <p>Then cooked the soup by slowly adding water and stirring it gently [hard work!]</p> <p>Dinner is served! :-)</p> <p><a href="http://www.richardhsu.net/images/Adifferentdinnersausagesoupgarlicbreadan_14A83/sausgeNpotatoes11.jpg"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="392" src="http://www.richardhsu.net/images/Adifferentdinnersausagesoupgarlicbreadan_14A83/sausgeNpotatoes_thumb7.jpg" width="640" border="0"></a> </p> <p>[have not been making photos of late and it shows]</p>
