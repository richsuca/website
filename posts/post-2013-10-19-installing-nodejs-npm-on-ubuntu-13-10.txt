To try <a href="https://en.ghost.org/" title="Ghost Blogging">Ghost blogging platform</a>, I had to install nodejs and npm. Was not straight forward so wanted to share what commands I ran to get it installed.


<pre>
sudo apt-get install nodejs 
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node 
curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
</pre>
