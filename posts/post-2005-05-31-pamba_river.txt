Luckily, my co-worker and friend Gibi was getting married on Sunday and we got to attend it. His 'native place' as they like to call it here, is a small town  called Chengannur in Kerala. I stayed over night at my other co-worker Deepu's place nearby and travelled back to Kochi on his bullet the next morning. <br /><br />Took this photo while in Chengannur.<br />
