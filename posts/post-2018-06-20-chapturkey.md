My son has two dictionaries: Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary, and The Kid Dictionary. The Kid Dictionary has made up words to describe the indescribable and it is hilarious!

I don't remember him ever using the Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary and I doubt it is still around.

The other night, while reading the story of The Brave Little Tailor (again) to my daughter at bedtime, I was sleepy and skipped a few paragraphs on the last page. My son, who was also in bed but listening, jumped up and told me to pause.

He went to his bookshelf, pulled out The Kid Dictionary, flipped over to page 40, then read out loud: CHAPTURN (verb). "To sneakily skip pages when reading a long children's book to your kid."

Then, turning to page 41, he read: CHAPTURKEY (noun). "A parent who gets caught skipping pages when reading a long children's book to his or her kid".
