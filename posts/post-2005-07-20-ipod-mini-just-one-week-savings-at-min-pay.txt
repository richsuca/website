<p>The advantage of living in a developed country like Canada can be illustrated by how long one takes to save up for an iPod mini. A guy i know recently bought an iPod mini from Apple.com for about Canadian$ 260. How long does it take to save C$ 260 ?</p>
<p>The official minimum salary is about C$ 8 per hour. So you are guaranteed to get C$ 8 per hour or more. Most people get more. Still, say you get C$ 8/hour for 40 hours a week [which again is standard], you end up with C$ 320!!, of course you have to subtract taxes etc.</p>
<p>Even at the maximum [30%], at minimum salary, one can save C$ 224 a week. With this, one can buy a reconditioned iPod mini for C$ ~190 OR work one more day and buy a brand new iPod mini from Apple.com.</p>
<p>I don't think there is much to say about, by Indian minimum salary standards, how long would it take to save up for iPod mini [Rs. ~11,000 according to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.in/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=104136&amp;item=5789403630&amp;rd=1">eBay India</a>].</p>
<p>No. I am not buying one [I am unemployed right now, so I can only save C$ 0.00]</p>
