I am subscribed to <a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/">WordSmith's A Word A Day</a> and today's word was <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/horatio_alger.html">Horatio Alger</a>. That's not the reason for this post, the interesting part is that the mail had a <a href="http://gutenberg.org/author/Horatio+Alger">link</a> to an eBook which had Horatio Alger's stories. I don't know exactly what made me go to the next page and download the <a href="http://gutenberg.org/etext/5623">"The Young Explorer"</a>. So far, I've read only the first chapter and its so much fun. Its a book a child can read. Simple and very interesting, reminds me of my young self. :-)
<br />
<br />Here is something I find the most interesting in chapter 1: Ben, a boy of 16 says to his Uncle "I want to go to California."
<br />
<br />I am curious and excited about what young Ben will do in California, how he'll survive alone, the people he'll meet and the trials &amp; tribulations that he'll go through to find his fortune.
<br />
<br />I am child at heart and there's a smile on my face, just like a child who has got a new toy to play with.
