<p>A friend’s Acer laptop was slow and she asked me to look into it. The approach I took is similar to the one for <a title="Asus laptop cleanup" href="http://richardhsu.net/2012/01/10/removing-useless-preloaded-applications-from-asus-laptop/">Asus</a> but since this was Acer, I had to do research on Acer specific ‘bloatware’/‘crapware’.</p>
<p>Microsoft sells computers with the “<a title="Microsoft Signature Experience" href="https://signature.microsoft.com">Signature Experience</a>&quot; that comes without any ‘bloatware’/‘crapware’ (what they call 'junk ware'/'trialware'). If you are buying a new Windows computer, I recommend <a title="Microsoft Store" href="http://content.microsoftstore.com/en-us/Home.aspx">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a partial summary of work done to get Windows 7 working responsively again.</p>
<h4>Work done</h4>
<ol>
<li>Reset Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Reset Google Chrome</li>
<li>Make Google Chrome default</li>
<li>Setup Power button to Hibernate instead of Shutdown (to reduce startup time)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Removed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Acer Backup Manager</li>
<li>Bing Bar</li>
<li>Rogers Online Protection (subscription service)</li>
<li>Rogers Servicepoint Agent</li>
<li>Norton Online Backup</li>
<li>MyWinLocker Suite</li>
<li>Acer Registration</li>
<li>eBay</li>
</ul>
<p>Installed:<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials &amp; run a Quick scan.</p>
<p>Finally, I reviewed logs and investigated and resolved the errors. One of these was a DHCP error which was causing the Wireless connections at startup to run very slow. I disabled the unused Intel Wireless Display network components and this was resolved.</p>
<p>What I started but could not complete:<br />
<a title="Spinrite" href="https://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm">Spinrite</a> maintenance (would have taken days to scan 700GB)</p>
<p>What I should have done but missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <a title="MSRT" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx">Malicious Software Removal Tool</a> <strong>first thing</strong></li>
<li>Run <a title="Secunia PSI" href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/">Secunia PSI</a> to find out if all programs are updated or not.</li>
</ul>
