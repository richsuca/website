<p>My son is a Ninjago fan. Getting him to colour Kai or Cole is easy except the images he likes don't always come in a form suitable for colouring. The online tutorials on how to convert images to line art did not work for me so I got professional help from my brother Robert. He did not disappoint. Within a few hours, I got an email from him. He came up with a way to convert images to line art (for dummies). It works really well!</p>
