Six years ago, I made a fundamental mistake and got [80 underexposed][1] or blurry photos for my friendly neighbour Arun's birthday party. Last November, I was at the same house, with similar lighting conditions, and the same camera (his Canon DSLR), but this time for his wife Mangala's birthday party.

I did a better job this time. Very few photos were underexposed. I am writing these down if I ever get to do it again.

Settings I used:

- External YongNuo flash was pointed at the ceiling, slightly angled forward
- The white card on the flash was raised to reflect light to the faces
- Flash was in automatic TTL exposure mode (I regret this)
- Camera on Shutter Priority (_Tv_ in the dial)
- Shutter set to 1/100th
- ISO set to Auto (it picked 400 for all the photos)
- Aperture was Auto
- Autofocus (9-points covered most of the view)

I made 117 photos on birthday eve when they set up the decorations. Then, another 200 pictures for the birthday party dinner.

The photos were first reviewed in [FastRawViewer][4] to decide which ones to reject. Photography Life has a [good article][5] on using FastRawViewer. I use a simplified culling process.

FastRawViewer is keyboard friendly:

- Left/Right arrows navigate
- x for Reject (moves into a _Rejected folder)
- z for Zoom
- p to show edges, fine details (indicates in-focus area)

The selected photos were then copied to an SD card and imported into the iPhone, where basic edits were applied in [Darkroom][3] app (something I learnt recently from Sean Tucker's [YouTube video][2]). From Darkroom, the edited photos were exported into Google Drive and shared.

Things to try next time:

- iPad would be better than iPhone for Darkroom
- Manual power mode in flash
- ISO from 400 to 640 (half stop brighter)?
- Fuji + 18 f2 + Flash?
