<p>My friend fell victim to a computer virus(The Bad). After my standard approaches to remove the virus (including MSRT, online solutions) failed, I resorted to factory reset for the Asus laptop. Factory reset was simple and convenient (compared to installing Windows followed by drivers etc.) and completed successfully(The Good) but then I had to spend another hour removing useless preloaded applications(The Ugly).</p>
<p>Shame on Asus for making their customers suffer these 'bloatware'/'crapware' .</p>
<p>If I did not have the below guide, it would have taken me more time (Thanks David)
