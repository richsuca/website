<p>This happens often. At a restaurant, grocery or mall, my son will ask me if he can go pee-pee. I will show him the way to the washroom and wait outside, after doing his business, he will come out and I will ask if he washed his hands. He will smile and go back to the washroom again. :) I have not had to ask a second time.</p>
<p>I know what you must be thinking. He is an honest boy ;)</p>
