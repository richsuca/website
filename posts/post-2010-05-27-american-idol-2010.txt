<p>While my two favourites did make it to the final. The only song that stayed with me is &quot;Leave Right Now&quot; by Will Young (winner of 2002 Pop Idol). His song would play week after week when contestants are voted out and they show a video of their &quot;journey&quot;. He also performed at the finale which prompted me to buy the song from iTunes!</p>
<p>Its just my taste I guess. Or maybe, the live versions you hear on TV does not sound as good as studio recorded songs. I will look up the performances in iTunes later. I might like some enough to buy them.</p>
<p>Along with ending of American Idol 2010, my other favourite TV show 24 also ended. That should free up a lot of time for me in the summer.</p>
