I was given a laptop to work on last december and since then I've been using it for work as well as for my personal communications. Its not crashed once and I've slowly got used to its slowness. Its travelled with me to many places and I've done a lot of really interesting things in it.
<br />
<br />Tomorrow, I start on a journey to return it to my employer. For good.
<br />
<br />In fact, as I write this blog, its being reset to its original state, wiping out all the programs installed, all the little settings done, all tweaked to my personal preferences and to make it work fastest.
<br />
<br />Funny that I feel a little heart burn at losing a piece of computer hardware. Words escape me and it is at moments like these that I wish I had the vocabulary and the ability to express like my friend Anita or Deepak G.
