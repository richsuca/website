<p>Picture this. An evening at an outdoor Ice Skating rink. It is around Christmas time so the mood is festive and warm. People in their winter coats, jackets, gloves, hats are skating in circles. You hear giggles, laughs, and talks as they go gracefully around the rink. Some are skating in pairs, holding hands. Then it starts to snow! It is beautiful.</p>
<p>This was something I had only seen in movies and TV shows but yesterday, when my son and I went skating, it was real and it was beautiful. My son said &quot;It's like The Winter Classic&quot; (NHL Ice Hockey game played outdoors are called The Winter Classic).</p>
